Miscellaneous cleanups/optimizations, along with start of new NEWS.

Fixed glitch that would prevent pipelining into MODOP.

Fixed NAMEDCNT bug in assignment of repeated elements to a list array;
added tests for such cases.

Fixed ifelse bug introduced earlier in pqR, and sped it up a bit more.
Also put in S4 check from R-3.0.0.

Now pay attention to MAT_MULT_WITH_BLAS_IN_HELPERS_OK for complex
matrix multiplication.

Fixed bug in reusing operand where "name" attribute not removed.

In interactive session, allow value returned at top level to not
have been computed yet.  Of course, we have to wait for it if it
ends up being printed.

Now warn of dangers of -O3 in R-admin.
