Two changes to how expressions are evaluated.

First, a facility has been introduced for an expression to be
evaluated in a context in which a "variant result" is allowed - eg, if
the result will be ignored anyway (expression is evaluated only for
side effects), a null result might be allowed.  This is done by
introducing an "evalv" function that is like "eval" but with an extra
parameter saying what variant results are permissible.  This facility
is used for later modifications, with some symbols defined here in
anticipation of these modifications.

Second, calling of primitive functions has been speeded up by copying
relevant information (eg, arity) from the table defining primitives
(in names.c) to fields in the SEXP for the primitive.  This saves
table access computations and also division and remainder operations
to get at the information in the "eval" field in names.c, which is
encoded as decimal digits.

A procedure SET_PRIMFUN in memory.c was surreptitiously changing the
function pointer for a primitive via the function pointer access
macro, PRIMFUN.  A SET_PRIMFUN macro now does this properly.

Code in saveload.c (for loading old workspaces?) creates a primitive
directly, bypassing the mkPRIMSXP procedure.  This seems unwise, since
creation via mkPRIMSXP is apparently needed to ensure protection of
primitives.  Whatever is going on there should not be affected by this
modification, however.

R-ints.texi has been updated to document evalv and variants.
