INTRODUCTION

SGGC manages "objects", containing data and other information, using a
"mark and sweep" garbage collector, modified to use several
"generations", so that a complete mark and sweep is done only
occasionally.  The design of SGGC is meant to allow an application to
use a memory-efficient storage scheme, while also providing fast
access to data.

Internally, SGGC uses "compressed pointers" to refer to objects,
consisting of a segment index and offset within segment.  The set
facility described in set-doc is used to manage sets of objects in
terms of such compressed pointers.  The application may also use
compressed pointers exclusively, or may use regular pointers except
when communicating with the SGGC functions.

See sggc-doc for details on the application interface for SGGC,
knowledge of which is assumed in this document.


INITIALIZATION

Currently, the maximum number of segments that may be used is fixed at
initialization time, when several arrays of that size are allocated.
This maximum is limited to 2^26-1, but always allocating space for
this maximum would occupy an excessive amount of virtual memory on
some systems.

More options for initialization may be provided in future.  Static
allocation may be an option, with the maximum number of segments fixed
at compile time, as this may slightly improve speed.  Alternatively,
there may be an option to allow dynamic increases in the number of
segments, by copying the arrays subscripted by segment indexes to
larger arrays.


REPRESENTATION OF DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION FOR AN OBJECT

The data and other information for an object consist of a single-byte
"type" for the object, a main data part, and optionally up to two
pieces of auxiliary information.

The type is the same for all objects in a segment, and therefore does
not need to be stored for each object.  (This is one reason that types
are handled separately from other information about an object.)  Types
for segments are stored in an array of unsigned characters, which is
subscripted by the segment index part of a compressed pointer to
obtain the type for an object.

The main data part of an object can vary in size, according to the
object's type and "length", in a manner defined by the application,
using the concept of a segment "kind" (which includes both the object
type and something about size).  The number of bytes of data
associated with an object is always a multiple of SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE,
which is defined by the application, and which for efficiency should
be a power of two (allowing multiplication by shifting).  The
application specifies the number of chunks for each kind of object.
The number of chunks of data associated with an object might sometimes
be more than required, in order to limit the number of "kinds", which
may allow better reuse of data space, or because the application
wishes to allow for the possibility that the amount of data needed for
an object could increase during its lifetime.

Objects with data of indefinite size are put in "big" segments, which
are of a kind for which the number of chunks is specified as zero
(meaning anything).  Big segments contain only one object, with
"offset" zero.  The number of big segments is therefore limited to at
most 2^26-1, which is about 64 million (less if there are also some
small segments), but if these big segments are indeed big, exceeding
this limit is likely to require more memory than would typically be
available.

Small segments may contain more than one object, and are of a kind
with a specified number of chunks of data for an object, which will be
between 1 and SGGC_CHUNKS_IN_SMALL_SEGMENT, currently 64.  The data
for all objects in the segment is allocated as a contiguous block of
SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE times SGGC_CHUNKS_IN_SMALL_SEGMENT bytes.  If the
number of chunks of data for the kind is 1, a segment of this kind can
contain up to 64 objects, which will have offsets from 0 to 63.  The
number of possible objects in a segment is reduced if they require
more than one chunk for their data - eg, a segment of a kind for which
the number of chunks of data is 5 will be able to store only 12
objects, which are given offsets of 0, 5, 10, 15, ..., 55.  Currently,
there will be 4 chunks of unused space at the end of the data space
for such a segment.  This is done in order to keep the data for all
small segments the same size, which aids reuse.

With this scheme, the maximum amount of memory that can be occupied by
the data for small segments is 2^26-1 times 64 times SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE
(less if there are also some big segments).  A typical value for
SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE might be 16, which would give a limit of about 32
Gigabytes of data in small segments.

With this scheme for assigning offsets to objects, finding the address
of the data for an object from a compressed pointer to it can be done
as follows:

  1) Find the address of the data block for the segment by indexing
     an array of pointers by the index part of the compressed pointer.

  2) Add SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE times the offset part of the compressed
     pointer to the address of the data block found in (1).  The
     required multiply will reduce to a shift if SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE is a
     power of two.

Step (1) will involve fetching the pointer to the array of data block
pointers (which may often have previously been fetched into a
register, since it will be needed for many accesses), shifting the
compressed pointer right to obtain the index part, and then doing an
indexed fetch of the data block address.  Step (2) will involve
masking out the offset part of the compressed pointer, shifting it to
perform the multiplication by SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE, and then adding it to
the data block address.  The last addition (and perhaps the
multiplication) may in some cases be merged with further address
arithmetic that is needed to obtain a particular item from the
object's data.

If used by the application, auxiliary information 1 is the same size
(SGGC_AUX1_SIZE) for all objects, and is allocated in blocks
containing sufficient space for some multiple (SGGC_AUX1_BLOCK_SIZE)
of the amount needed for SGGC_CHUNKS_IN_SMALL_SEGMENT objects (which
is the maximum number of objects that might be in a segment, currently
64).  An application might arrange that the size of these allocation
blocks is the same as the size of a data block for a small segment,
since this might help with allocation and reuse by malloc.

The address of the auxiliary information for an object is found from a
compressed pointer in the same way as data is found, described by
steps (1) and (2) above, except that SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE is replaced by
SGGC_AUX1_SIZE, and of course a different array of pointers is used.
Auxiliary information may often consist of a single small data item,
in which case the processor may have indexing instructions that will
allow these steps to be performed especially quickly.

Small segments for which an object's data occupies more than one chunk
cannot contain objects with all possible offsets.  Accordingly, the
auxiliary information found in this way is distributed with unused
gaps between the parts that are (or may be) used by objects in one
segment.  To avoid wasting this space, multiple segments of the same
kind share the same space for auxiliary information, in an interleaved
fashion.  Similarly, many big segments, containing only one object,
will be allocated auxiliary information from one allocation block.

If the application also uses auxiliary information 2, it is handled in
the same way as auxiliary information 1.

An application may arrange that auxiliary information 1 and/or 2 for
some kinds of segments is read-only, and perhaps shared between
segments.  In particular, if the auxiliary information is irrelevant
for some type of object, it can be set to shared dummy data, avoiding
wasting space for this information when it is not used.  However,
auxiliary information cannot be read-only for "big" segments, since
this would make re-using auxiliary information more difficult.

In addition to possible quicker access and perhaps sharing, another
reason for use of auxiliary information may be that it could let other
data fit neatly (considering alignment requirements) in some multiple
of SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE bytes, without wasteful padding.


GENERATIONAL GARBAGE COLLECTION

The design of SGGC assumes that it is typical for many objects to be
allocated, used briefly, and then no longer referenced, while some
other objects are allocated and then used (or at least are still
referenced) for a long time.

Accordingly, SGGC uses a "generational" garbage collector in which
objects that have survived one or two garbage collections are regarded
as being in "old generation 1" or "old generation 2", and are not
garbage collected unless a "level 1" or "level 2" garbage collection
is done.  Collection at "level 0" looks (mostly) at only those objects
that were allocated since the last garbage collection, and will not
recover unused objects in old generations 1 or 2.  Similarly,
collection at level 1 looks only at newly-allocated objects and
objects in old generation 1, and will not recover unused objects in
old generation 2.  Collection at level 2 looks at all objects (except
constant objects), and will recover all unused objects, but of course
takes longer than a level 0 or level 1 collection.

Constant objects may reference only other constant objects, but may be
referenced from any object.  Constant objects may also be stored in
read-only memory.  Constant objects are never looked at or collected
by the garbage collector.

When collecting at level 0 or level 1, it is necessary to handle the
possibility that some objects in the generations being collected are
referred to by an object that is not being collected, and hence is not
looked at by the usual marking procedure.  It is assumed that such
references are fairly uncommon, as otherwise the generational scheme
will not be advantageous.  The exceptions where old-to-new references
do exist are handled by keeping track of which objects in old
generation 1 or old generation 2 may contain such references, assisted
by the application calling the sggc_old_to_new_check procedure when
necessary, as documented in sggc-doc.


SETS OF OBJECTS AND THEIR USE

SGGC maintains several sets of objects, using the set facilities
documented in set-doc.  Some of these sets share the same 'chain'.
There are five chains, identified by symbols defined in set-app.h (the
application specific header file for use of the set facility by SGGC),
as follows:

  SET_UNUSED_FREE_NEW   Used for sets of free or newly-allocated objects
                        of different kinds, called 'free_or_new[k]' for
                        each kind k, and a set of unused big segments,
                        called 'unused'.

  SET_OLD_GEN1          Used for the set of objects in old generation 1,
                        called 'old_gen1'.

  SET_OLD_GEN2_CONST    Used for the set of objects in old generation 2,
                        called 'old_gen2', and for the set of constant 
                        objects, called 'constants'.

  SET_OLD_TO_NEW        Used for the set of objects possibly having 
                        old-to-new references, called 'old_to_new'.

  SET_TO_LOOK_AT        Used for the set of objects that need to be
                        looked at to follow pointers they contain,
                        called 'to_look_at'.

Note that with five chains, plus four bytes of extra information used
by SGGC, the size of a set_segment structure is 64 bytes, which may be
a good size for cache performance.  It would also allow efficient
indexing of arrays of segments, though this is not relevant with the
current implementation.

Between calls of sggc_collect, for kinds, k, that use small segments,
'free_or_new[[k]' contains objects in segments that have data and
auxiliary information allocated.  Some of these objects are
newly-allocated (since the last call of sggc_collect), and may still
be in use, and others are free.  The free objects form a sequential
subset delimited by the compressed pointers in 'next_free[k]', which
is the next free object of kind k, and 'end_free[k]', which is the
first object after the free sequence (or SGGC_NO_OBJECT if the free
sequence goes to the end of the set).  A call of sggc_alloc for an
object of a small-segment kind, k, will use the object from
'free_or_new[k]' identified by 'next_free[k]', unless this is equal to
'end_free[k]', indicating that no free objects are available for reuse
(in which case sggc_alloc_zeroed is called to obtain new space).

If k uses big segments, 'free_or_new[[k]' contains only newly
allocated objects between calls of sggc_collect.  Allocation for
objects that are stored in big segments is done by looking for an
existing segment in the 'unused' set, which is shared by all the kinds
that use big segments.  These objects have auxiliary information
already allocated (which is the same for all kinds, and cannot be
read-only), but do not have a data area allocated - one is allocated
using sggc_alloc_zeroed when the segment becomes used.  If 'unused' is
empty, a new segment, data, and auxiliary information are allocated
using sggc_alloc_zeroed.

At the start of garbage collection at level 1, objects in 'old_gen1'
of kind k (with k being determinable from the compressed pointer for
an object) are added to the 'free_or_new[k]' set.  For collection at
level 2, this is done for both 'old_gen1' and 'old_gen2'.

When during the marking stage of garbage collection, an object in a
generation being collected is found to still be in use, it is removed
from its 'free_or_new' set (in sggc_look_at), and later (when looked
at) added to 'old_gen1' if newly-allocated, or to 'old_gen2' if
currently in 'old_gen1', or left in 'old_gen2' if it was already
there.

The 'constants' set is added to only when the application registers a
new constant object, and never has elements removed.  Constants can be
distinguished from objects in the 'old_gen2' set (which shares the
same chain) by the fact that big segments are never constants and by
the 'constant' flag stored in small segments.  The fact that these two
sets share a chain is convenient when checking whether an object can
be referenced from an object in old generation 2 without using
old-to-new.

When a garbage collection is not in progress, the 'to_look_at' set is
empty.  During a garbage collection, as objects are marked as in use,
from sggc_find_root_ptrs or sggc_find_object_ptrs calling
sggc_look_at, they are added to the 'to_look_at' set, from which
objects are repeatedly removed, and passed to sggc_find_object_ptrs,
until the 'to_look_at' set becomes empty.  This avoids use of
recursion to following references to objects from other objects.

Once the marking process has finished, the objects in all the
'free_or_new[k]' sets are known to be unused.  However, some of them
may still be in 'old_gen2' or 'old_gen1', so these sets are scanned to
remove elements that are in a set in the SET_UNUSED_FREE_NEW chain.
Such objects are also removed from the 'old_to_new' set (see below).


HANDLING OLD-TO-NEW REFERENCES

When garbage collection is done level 0, only newly-allocated objects
(generation 0) are potentially collected, so objects in old
generations 1 and 2 do not need to be examined - except that if an
object in one of these older generations may refer to a
newly-allocated object, this must be visible to the garbage collector,
so that it will not erroneously reuse this referenced object.
Similarly, in a garbage collection at level 1, objects in old
generation 2 need not be examined - except for those that may refer to
newly-allocated objects or objects in old generation 1.

To achieve this, the 'old_to_new' set contains objects in old
generation 1 that may refer to a newly-allocated (generation 0)
object, and objects in old generation 2 that may refer to an object in
either generation 1 or generation 0.  Whan a garbage collection is
done, the objects in the 'old_to_new' set are scanned, and any
references to an object in a generation being collected from an object
in a generation that is not being collection that is in the
'old_to_new' set is noted as being referenced.  Also during this scan,
objects in the 'old_to_new" set that will no longer contain a
reference to a younger object after this collection are removed from
'old_to_new'.

During a level 0 garbage collection, old-to-new entries for objects in
old generation 1 can be removed (after being used), since after
collection any referenced objects in generation 0 will also be in old
generation 1, and hence there will no longer be any old-to-new
references.  In a level 0 collection, old-to-new entries for objects
in old generation 2 must be retained if they have any references to
objects in generation 0 or 1, which will both be in generation 1 after
the level 0 collection.

In a level 1 or level 2 garbage collection, objects in 'old_to_new'
that are currently in old generation 1 (and hence will be in old
generation 2 after the collection, if they survive) are examined, but
only to determine whether or not they should remain in the
'old_to_new' set.  References to newly-allocated objects from these
objects are not marked as in use, since it is unknown whether or not
the object referring to them is still in use.  (They will be marked by
the usual process if the referring object is in use.)  However, if a
reference to a newly-allocated object is found, the generation 1
object referring to it is not removed from 'old_to_new', since if this
object survives collection, becoming generation 2, it will contain a
reference to a generation 1 object.  Once such a reference is found,
no further references need be examined, which is indicated to the
application by having sggc_look_at return zero.

The actions to do for old-to-new references when collecting at each
level are summarized below:

  level 0:
  
      gen    gen    keep in       stop       mark
     from     to   old-to-new?  looking?  the to ptr?
  
        2      0       yes         no        yes
        2      1       yes         no         no (won't anyway)
        2      2        no         no         no (won't anyway)
  
        1      0        no         no        yes
        1      1        no         no         no (won't anyway)
        1      2        no         no         no (won't anyway)
  
  level 1:
  
      gen    gen    keep in       stop       mark
     from     to   old-to-new?  looking?  the to ptr?
  
        2      0       yes         no        yes
        2      1        no         no        yes
        2      2        no         no         no (won't anyway)
  
        1      0       yes        yes         no
        1      1        no         no         no
        1      2        no         no         no (won't anyway)
  
  level 2:
  
      gen    gen    keep in       stop       mark
     from     to   old-to-new?  looking?  the to ptr?
  
        2      0       yes        yes         no
        2      1        no         no         no
        2      2        no         no         no
  
        1      0       yes        yes         no
        1      1        no         no         no
        1      2        no         no         no


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Possible (or likely) extensions and efficiency improvements for SGGC
include the following:

  o The procedures used by the set facility for finding the
    lowest-order 1 bit and counting the number of 1 bits in a 64-bit
    word could be sped up, including arranging somehow for special
    processor instructions to be used if available.

  o Additional procedures could be included in the set facility to
    allow operations such as putting all objects in an old generation
    into a free_or_new set to be done an entire segment at a time,
    giving a large speed improvement for small segments that contain
    many objects.

  o The need to mask out just the offset part of a compressed pointer
    when computing the address of its data or auxiliary information
    may be eliminated by adjusting the pointers to data or auxiliary
    information for a segment so that the correct result is obtained
    when the unmasked index is present along with the offset.

  o Currently, small segments of a given kind are never freed, nor
    reused for a different kind, which could cause problems if many
    objects of one kind are allocated, and then most of them become
    unused.  It would be possible to have a 'small_unused' set that
    contains objects in small segments that have only unused objects.
    Segments that are entirely free could be identified when
    allocating an object (moving them to 'small_unused' at that time,
    preferring to allocate from a partially-used segment), or in a
    separate pass over the 'free_or_new' sets at the end of a level 2
    garbage collection.  The currently unused set_move_first and
    set_move_next procedures provided by the set facility are intended
    to facilitate this.  The segments in 'small_unused' could then be
    reused for any small kind.  Their data areas might or might not be
    freed when they are put in 'small_unused' (perhaps only if a call
    of sggc_alloc_zeroed fails).

  o Currently, SGGC never frees memory used for auxiliary information,
    though it may be reused for other objects of the same kind.  If
    many objects of some kind are allocated, and then most of them
    become unused, this could lead to a large amount of memory being
    allocated but unused.  A block of memory used for auxiliary
    information could be freed once all objects using that block are
    no longer in use.  There is currently no data structure support
    for identifying such blocks, and adding such support would
    probably increase the amount of memory used per object, but these
    blocks could be identified by scanning the 'free_or_new' and
    'unused' sets while maintaining a hash table of auxiliary data
    block addresses.  There is current support for finding the start
    of the auxiliary information block used by an object, via the
    aux1_off and aux2_off fields in a segment.

  o Currently, SGGC immediately frees the data area for a big segment
    once it is known to be unused.  This may be inefficient,
    especially if malloc uses high-overhead memory-mapping system
    calls to allocate and release data areas.  Some way of often
    reusing the data area for a future object that needs a data area
    with the same or slightly smaller size might be beneficial.

  o The space required to store types for segments could be eliminated
    by encoding the type in the segment index.  This would also speed
    up access to type information.  For example, if there are 32
    possible types, they could be identified by the low-order 5 bits
    of a segment index.  This would of course require that segments of
    different types be allocated indexes with the right low-order
    bits.  There would (for this example) be a limit of 2^21 (which is
    about 2 million) segments of any particular type.  If each segment
    had a data area of 1024 bytes, this would give a limit of 2 GBytes
    of data for one type, which might sometimes be a problem, though
    likely not on a system with a 32-bit address space.

  o More information could be maintained in sggc_info to help the
    application decide when to call sggc_collect.

  o A function could be provided that determines whether or not a
    32-bit word is a valid compressed pointer, to an object that is
    not currently free.  This could be done fairly efficiency (ie,
    with a fairly small number of fetches and tests, without any
    searching), by adding a flag in small segments that is set if any
    object in the segment is in the free portion of a free_or_new set.
