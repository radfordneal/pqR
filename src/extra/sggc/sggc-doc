INTRODUCTION

This library manages memory for "objects" that contain data, which may
include references to other objects.  It is designed for use by an
interpreter for a language such as R, though use in other applications
would also be possible.

The SGGC library provides the application with a function for
allocating a new object.  Memory for objects that are no longer in use
is automatically freed or reused, when the application initiates a
garbage collection.  To allow identification and recovery of unused
objects, the application must provide procedures for finding all
"root" pointers to objects, and for finding all pointers to other
objects that are contained in an object.  The application also
provides information regarding "types" of objects, and how much
storage they require, which for the main data storage may vary by type
(according to more detailed "kind" information).

Objects are allocated in "segments", and can be referenced by a pair
consisting of a segment index and an offset within a segment.  Such
"compressed pointers" will fit in a 32-bit word (with the current
configuration of SGGC), even when regular pointers are 64 bits in
size.  SGGC is designed to allow fast translation of a compressed
pointer to a regular pointer to data (which for "small" segments is
allocated as a block for all objects in the segment).  An application
may optionally choose for objects to be associated with one or two
pieces of auxiliary information, also quickly accessible using a
compressed pointer.  Unlike the main data, auxiliary information has
the same size for all objects.  An application can make auxiliary
information for some objects be read-only, and shared with other
objects.

An application can choose whether to use compressed pointers for all
object references, or (for the application's purposes) to sometimes or
always use regular pointers.  If regular pointers are used, however,
each object will need to store a compressed pointer to itself in its
data space, to allow translation from regular to compressed pointers,
as the application must sometimes pass compressed pointers to SGGC.

Memory is freed using a "mark and sweep" garbage collector, with three
"generations" of objects, often allowing quick recovery of recently
allocated objects without the cost of a full sweep (depending on the
"level" of collection).  The SGGC library does not decide when a
garbage collection will be done, or at what level, but instead
provides information allowing the application to implement a policy in
this regard.


USING SGGC IN AN APPLICATION

To use SGGC, an application should create an sggc-app.h file, which
must define some constants and declare some types (see below) and then
include the sggc.h file.  The sggc-app.h file should be included in
application modules that use the SGGC library, and is also included in
the source file for the SGGC library routines.

The following constants must be declared with #define in sggc-app.h,
before it includes sggc.h:

  SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE       Number of bytes in a data chunk.  Should be a 
                        power of two for efficiency, and must be a
                        multiple of 8 for alignment reasons.

  SGGC_N_TYPES          Number of types of objects.

  SGGC_N_KINDS          Number of kinds of objects (at least SGGC_N_TYPES).

  SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS      An array initializer giving the number of data 
                        chunks for each kind of object, 0 if the kind uses
                        "big" segments (with variable numbers of chunks).

The following constant must be defined if the sggc_alloc_small_kind 
function is used (see below):

  SGGC_KIND_TYPES       An array initializer giving the type for each
                        kind of object.

The following may optionally be defined, if auxiliary information 1 or
auxiliary information 2 is to be used:

  SGGC_AUX1_SIZE        Number of bytes in auxiliary information 1 
                        (same for all kinds of objects).  Should be
                        a power of two for efficiency.

  SGGC_AUX2_SIZE        As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

  SGGC_AUX1_BLOCK_SIZE  Number of blocks of auxiliary information 1
                        allocated at once.  Each block has space for
                        auxiliary information for as many objects as
                        there are data chunks for a small segment.
                        The total number of items of auxiliary
                        information allocated at once must be no more
                        than 256 (since offsets in it are stored in an
                        unsigned char).

  SGGC_AUX2_BLOCK_SIZE  As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

  SGGC_AUX1_READ_ONLY   If defined (as anything), the application may
                        sometimes use read-only auxiliary information 1.

  SGGC_AUX2_READ_ONLY   As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

The following symbol may be defined to indicate that the application
needs to perform operations after preliminary marking of objects in
use during a garbage collection:

  SGGC_AFTER_MARKING    If defined (as anything), the application will
                        provide an sggc_after_marking procedure to call
                        after preliminary marking of objects (see below).
                        This procedure may call sggc_not_marked to see
                        which objects are known to be in use, and may
                        call sggc_look_at to mark additional objects as
                        in use.

The following may be defined to specify the maximum number of segments
allowed at compile time, so that they will be statically rather than
dynamically allocated (for a possible speed advantage in data access):

  SGGC_MAX_SEGMENTS     The maximum number of segments allowed. If
                        specified, space for pointers to segment data
                        (but not the data itself) is allocated
                        statically, and the argument to sggc_init can
                        only reduce this limit, not increase it.

The following types must be defined in sggc-app.h:

  sggc_length_t         Type for the "length" of an object.  The
                        meaning of "length" is up to the application, 
                        but it is used in the SGGC interface.

  sggc_nchunks_t        Type for holding the number of chunks (with
                        SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE bytes) in the data for an
                        object.

An application may optionally define the following in sggc-app.h:

  sggc_alloc_zeroed     May be defined as a simple symbol or as a 
                        one-argument macro (not a function), which
                        is used by SGGC to allocate a block of memory
                        with the given number of bytes, which must be 
                        set to all zero bits, with return of NULL 
                        indicating failure.  The memory must be aligned
                        to an 8-byte boundary.  Defaults to a call of
                        the C library 'calloc' function.

  sggc_free             May be defined as a simple symbol or as a 
                        one-argument macro (not a function), which is
                        used by SGGC to free blocks of memory that
                        were allocated by sggc_alloc_zeroed.  Defaults
                        to the symbol 'free', the C library function.

The sggc.h file should be included after the above have been defined,
at the end of sggc-app.h.  It will define the following types:

  sggc_index_t          Type for holding the index of a segment.
                        Currently int32_t.

  sggc_cptr_t           Type for holding a compressed pointer.
                        Currently uint32_t.

  sggc_type_t           Type for holding an object type.
                        Currently unsigned char.

  sggc_kind_t           Type for holding an object kind (type & storage).
                        Currently unsigned char.

The following constants are also defined in sggc.h:

  SGGC_NO_OBJECT        A constant of type sggc_cptr_t that cannot be a
                        reference to an actual object, and hence can be
                        used to indicate "no object".

  SGGC_CHUNKS_IN_SMALL_SEGMENT  The number of chunks (each of size
                                SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE) for the data associated
                                with all objects in a "small" segment.

The sggc.h file will declare the following global structure variable,
which SGGC will continually update with information that the
application may use when deciding whether to call sggc_collect to do a
garbage collection:

  extern struct sggc_info
  {
    unsigned gen0_count;       /* Number of newly-allocated objects */
    unsigned gen1_count;       /* Number of objects in old generation 1 */
    unsigned gen2_count;       /* Number of objects in old generation 2.
                                  Does not include constants */

    sggc_nchunks_t big_chunks; /* # of chunks in newly-allocated big objects */

} sggc_info;

The sggc.h file will also declare the array initialized with the
application's definition of SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS in sggc-app.h, as
follows:

  const int sggc_kind_chunks[SGGC_N_KINDS];

Finally, the sggc.h file will declare prototypes (or macros, or static
inline definitions) for the functions documented below, some of which
may be used by the application, others of which must be defined by the
application for use by SGGC.

See sggc-imp for how to control some aspects of the implementation,
for which the best choice might depend on the system used.


TYPES, LENGTHS, AND KINDS

SGGC supports objects that are of different "types", identified by
integers from 0 to SGGC_N_TYPES-1, where SGGC_N_TYPES is defined by
the application (limited to being no bigger than 256).  Types of
objects are recorded by SGGC, but otherwise the meaning of a type is
up to the application.  Note that all objects in a segment will have
the same type.

The application also determines the meaning (if any) of the "length"
of an object - SGGC simply passes length values provided by the
application to functions the application defines.  It would be
possible for the application to completely ignore "length", just
passing some dummy value where a length is required.  More commonly,
however, the length will be used by the application when determining
the "kind" of an object.

All objects in a segment will be of the same kind, identified by a
number from 0 to SGGC_N_KINDS-1, where SGGC_N_KINDS is defined by the
application (limited to being no bigger than 256).  Some kinds are for
"big" segments, which can have data of any size.  Other kinds are for
"small" segments, in which the data associated with an object consists
of a fixed number of chunks (though objects need not use the entirety
of the data space allocated to them).  Whether a kind is for big or
small segments, and the number of chunks allocated for objects if they
are of a small kind, are determined by the value for SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS
that the application provides, which gives the numbers of chunks for
each kind, with zero indicating that the kind uses big segments.

The application provides a function (or macro) sggc_kind that
determines the kind of an object from its type and length.  The kind
returned by sggc_kind must not the same for different types (ie, the
type must be determinable from the kind).  There is also a restriction
that if the kind is for a big segment, it must be numerically equal to
the type.  Accordingly, for each type, there can be at most one kind
using big segments, though there could be several kinds for that type
that use small segments, perhaps with different numbers of data
chunks, depending on length.

The application also provides an sggc_nchunk function (or macro) that
returns the number of data chunks needed for an object of given type
and length.  This is called when SGGC needs to allocate space for a
big segment.

For example, the application might have the following definitions in
its sggc-app.h file:

  #define SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE 16 /* Number of bytes in a data chunk */
  #define SGGC_N_TYPES 3     /* Three types of objects: 0, 1, 2 */
  #define SGGC_N_KINDS 5     /* Five kinds of objects 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 */

  #define SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS \
                  { 1,       /* Kind 0 uses 1 data chunk, for type 0 */ \
                    2,       /* Kind 1 uses 2 data chunks, for type 1 */ \
                    0,       /* Kind 2 uses big segments, for type 2 */ \
                    2,       /* Kind 3 uses 2 data chunks, for type 2 */ \
                    6        /* Kind 4 uses 6 data chunks, for type 2 */ \
  }

  #define sggc_kind(type,length) \
    ((type) < 2 ? (type)     /* Types 0 and 1 use kinds 0 and 1 */ \
    : (length) <= 1 ? 3      /* Type 2 with length 1 or less can use kind 3 */ \
    : (length) <= 3 ? 4      /* Type 2 with length 3 or less can use kind 4 */ \
    : 2)                     /* Type 2 with length >3 must use a big segment */

  #define sggc_nchunks(type,length) \
    ((sggc_nchunks_t)(length) * 2) /* Number of chunks needed is twice length */

If an application defines the symbols SGGC_AUX1_READ_ONLY, it must
also provide a function called sggc_aux1_read_only that returns a
pointer to read-only auxiliary information 1 for a segment of a given
kind, or NULL if this information is not read-only for segments of
this kind.  Read-only auxiliary information is not allowed for kinds
that use big segments.

If SGGC_AUX2_READ_ONLY is defined, the application must similarly
provide an sggc_aux2_read_only function.


INFORMING SGGC ABOUT OBJECT REFERENCES

The application is responsible for ensuring that the SGGC routines
will be informed of all references to objects at any time when
sggc_collect is called.  This is done in three ways.

First, the application must provided an sggc_find_root_ptrs procedure.
This procedure must call the sggc_look_at function for every "root"
compressed pointer, which the application might use to directly refer
to an object.  In this context, the value returned by sggc_look_at may
be ignored.

Root pointers would, for example, include compressed pointers stored
in global variables used by the application.  If the application also
uses regular pointers (to data areas) as roots, sggc_find_root_ptrs
must be called with the corresponding compressed pointer, which the
application must somehow be able to find (eg, by storing a compressed
pointer to itself at the start of the data area for every object).

An application may also store root pointers in the local variables of
functions.  The application will need to implement some scheme for
finding all such local variables, and calling sggc_find_root_ptrs for
each of them, passing the compressed pointer for the reference.

Secondly, the application must provide an sggc_find_object_ptrs
procedure, which is passed a compressed pointer to an object, and
which must call sggc_look_at for every object that is referenced from
that object - except that if a call of sggc_look_at returns zero,
sggc_find_object_ptrs should return immediately without looking for
any more pointers.

Finally, the application must call the sggc_old_to_new_check procedure
whenever it may have modified an object in an older generation so that
it now refers to an object in a younger generation.  The arguments of
sggc_old_to_new_check are a compressed pointer to an object that has
just been modified and a compressed pointer to the object that it now
references.  If sggc_old_to_new_check sees that the first object is in
an older generation than the second, an appropriate record of this
will be kept, so that the newer object will be recognized as being
referenced even if the older object would not normally be looked at in
a partial garbage collection.

The sggc_old_to_new_check procedure does not have to be called if the
object being modified has just been allocated by sggc_alloc (with no
other calls of sggc_alloc since then).  An application can also
enquire with the sggc_youngest_generation function whether an object
is of the youngest generation, in which case modifications to it do
not have to be signaled with sggc_check_old_to_new (as long as
sggc_alloc is not called).  Similarly, an application can enquire with
the sggc_oldest_generation function whether an object is of the oldest
generation (or a constant), in which case modifications of any object
to refer to it do not have to be signaled with sggc_check_old_to_new.
The sggc_youngest_generation and sggc_oldest_generation functions are
useful only if more than one modification is to be made, since
sggc_old_to_new_check is a faster way of handling a single
modification.


FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY SGGC TO THE APPLICATION

The SGGC library provides an application with the functions (or
macros) below, which have (if functions) prototypes as shown:

  sggc_type_t SGGC_TYPE (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the type of the object whose compressed pointer is passed,
    an integer from 0 to SGGC_N_TYPES-1.

  sggc_type_t SGGC_KIND (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the kind of the object whose compressed pointer is passed,
    an integer from 0 to SGGC_N_KIND-1.

  char *SGGC_DATA (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns a regular pointer to the data associated with the object
    whose compressed pointer is passed.

  char *SGGC_AUX1 (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Exists only if the application defines SGGC_AUX1_SIZE in set-app.h.  

    Returns a regular pointer to the auxiliary information 1 for the
    object whose compressed pointer is passed.

  char *SGGC_AUX2 (sggc_cptr_t cptr)   (only if SGGC_AUX2_SIZE defined)

    Exists only if the application defines SGGC_AUX2_SIZE in set-app.h.  

    Returns a regular pointer to the auxiliary information 2 for the
    object whose compressed pointer is passed.

  sggc_cptr_t SGGC_CPTR_VAL (unsigned index, unsigned offset)

    Returns a compressed pointer constructed from the given segment
    index and offset.  This is needed only in a few specialized
    contexts.

  unsigned SGGC_SEGMENT_INDEX (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the segment index of a compressed pointer.  This is needed
    only in a few specialized contexts.

  unsigned SGGC_SEGMENT_OFFSET (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the offset within a segment of a compressed pointer.  This
    is needed only in a few specialized contexts.

  int sggc_init (int max_segments)

    Initializes the SGGC facility, with the maximum number of segments
    being as specified, except that this argument is silently reduced
    to SGGC_MAX_SEGMENTS if it is larger, if that constant was
    specified at compile time.  Returns zero if no error, and non-zero
    if allocation failed.

  sggc_cptr_t sggc_alloc (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

    Allocates space for an object of the specified type and length,
    returning a compressed pointer to the object, or SGGC_NO_OBJECT if
    space could not be allocated.  If SGGC_NO_OBJECT is returned, it
    is possible that if a garbage collection is then performed using
    sggc_collect, a subsequent call of sggc_alloc for the same type
    and length will succeed (though this will not always be the case).

    Note that the significance of type and length for the storage that
    is needed is determined by the application, via the sggc_kind
    function and the SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS initializer.

    The data area for the newly allocated object will be set to all
    zero bits, but any auxiliary information for the object will have
    undefined contents.

  sggc_cptr_t sggc_alloc_small_kind (sggc_kind_t)

    A faster alternative to sggc_alloc, which exists only if the
    application has defined SGGC_KIND_TYPE (see above).  It takes a
    kind of an object as its argument, which must not be a kind for a
    big segment.  The type and number of chunks needed are determined
    by this kind.  The function otherwise acts the same as sggc_alloc.

  void sggc_collect (int level)

    Performs a garbage collection operation, at the specified level.
    Level 0 attempts to recover only unused object that were allocated
    since the last garbage collection.  Level 1 also attempts to
    recover unused objects that have survived one garbage collection
    (only).  Level 2 attempts to recover all unused objects (except
    constants).

    Note that this function is never called automatically by SGGC.  
    It is up to the application to implement a policy for when to call
    the garbage collector, and at what level.

  int sggc_look_at (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    This function must be called from the sggc_find_root_ptrs and
    sggc_find_object_ptrs procedures that the application provides for
    SGGC (and must only be called from these procedures).  It signals
    to SGGC that the object referenced by the compressed pointer
    passed is accessible, via a root pointer or via a reference in
    another object, and hence should not be collected.  

    The return value of sggc_look_at should be ignored if it is called
    from sggc_find_root_ptrs.  If sggc_look_at is called from
    sggc_find_object_ptrs, a return value of zero indicates that the
    sggc_find_object_ptrs procedure should return immediately without
    looking for further references.

  void sggc_old_to_new_check (sggc_cptr_t from_ptr, sggc_cptr_t to_ptr)

    This procedure informs SGGC that the application has stored a
    reference to the object pointed to by to_ptr in the object pointed
    to by from_ptr (perhaps in the data area associated with from_ptr,
    or perhaps in the auxiliary information for from_ptr, as either a
    compressed pointer or regular pointer).
  
    The application must call this procedure whenever (ie, just after)
    a reference to another object is stored in an object, unless
    from_ptr can be guaranteed to be in the youngest generation of
    objects or to_ptr can be guaranteed to be in the oldest
    generation, or is a constant.  It is guaranteed that from_ptr is
    in the youngest generation if it has just been allocated, or if
    sggc_youngest_generation says it is in the youngest generation, as
    long as there has been no subsequent call of sggc_collect.  An
    object is guaranteed to be in the oldest generation (or constant)
    if sggc_oldest_generation (or sggc_is_constant) indicates that it
    is, and if so, it will remain so thereafter.

  int sggc_youngest_generation (sggc_cptr_t from_ptr)

    Returns 1 if the object pointed to by from_ptr is in the youngest
    generation - ie, was allocated since the last call of sggc_collect
    - and 0 otherwise.  Note that the object may cease to be in the
    youngest generation after the next call of sggc_collect.

  int sggc_oldest_generation (sggc_cptr_t to_ptr)

    Returns 1 if the object pointed to by from_ptr is in the oldest
    generation, or is a constant object, and 0 otherwise.  If an
    object is in the oldest generation (or a constant) it will remain
    so thereafter.

  int sggc_not_marked (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns 1 if the object with compressed pointer cptr has not been
    marked as in use during the garbage collection currently under
    way, and 0 otherwise.  This function may be called only from the
    sggc_after_marking procedure, which an application may supply, to
    be called after preliminary marking of objects in use.

  int sggc_is_constant (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns 1 if the object is in a constant, 0 otherwise. The data
    and auxiliary information in a constant object must not be

  sggc_cptr_t sggc_constant (sggc_type_t type, sggc_kind_t kind, 
                             int n_objects, char *data, 
                             char *aux1, char *aux2)

    Creates a segment containing constant objects, and returns the
    compressed pointer to the first object in this segment (compressed
    pointers to the other objects will have the same segment index but
    different offsets).

    The type and kind of the segment are specified by the first two
    arguments.  The kind must not specify a big segment.

    The 'n_objects' argument indicates how many objects are in the
    segment.  It must be at least 1, and no more than will fit in a
    segment.

    The 'data' argument is a pointer to the data block for objects in
    this segment.  The 'aux1' and 'aux2' arguments are pointers to the
    auxiliary information for the segment; they exist only if
    SGGC_AUX1_SIZE or SGGC_AUX2_SIZE are defined.

    If called several times before any calls of sggc_alloc, the
    segments will have indexes 0, 1, 2, etc., which fact may be used
    when setting up their contents if they reference each other.


FUNCTIONS THE APPLICATION MUST PROVIDE TO SGGC

The application defines the following functions called from the SGGC
library functions (which can instead be macros defined in sggc-app.h
before sggc.h is included):

  sggc_kind_t sggc_kind (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

    Returns the "kind" of a segment to be used for objects of the
    given type and length, identified by an integer from 0 to
    SGGC_N_KINDS-1.  Must return the same kind on all calls with the
    same type and length, and must return different kinds for
    different types.

  sggc_nchunks_t sggc_nchunks (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

    Returns the number of data chunks required for an object of the
    given type and length.  Called only when allocating space for big
    segments, so need handle only type and length combinations for
    which sggc_kind returns the kind of a big segment.

  void sggc_find_root_ptrs (void)

    This procedure must call sggc_look_at for every "root" pointer via
    which an object might be referenced, passing sggc_look_at the
    compressed pointer for that object.  See the discussion above
    for more context.

  void sggc_find_object_ptrs (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    This procedure must call sggc_look_at for every object that is
    referenced via 'cptr' (in any order), passing it the compressed
    pointer to the object that is referenced, except that if such a
    call of sggc_look_at returns 0, sggc_find_object_ptrs should
    immediately return, rather than calling sggc_look_at for the
    remaining objects referenced via 'cptr'.  See the discussion above
    for more context.

  char *sggc_aux1_read_only (sggc_kind_t kind)

    Only provided if the application defines SGGC_AUX1_READ_ONLY.
    
    Returns a pointer to the shared, read-only auxiliary information 1
    for a segment of the given kind, or NULL if this kind does not use
    read-only auxiliary information 1.  Will not be called with a
    'kind' that uses big segments.

  char *sggc_aux2_read_only (sggc_kind_t kind)

    Only provided if the application defines SGGC_AUX2_READ_ONLY.

    Returns a pointer to the shared, read-only auxiliary information 2
    for a segment of the given kind, or NULL if this kind does not use
    read-only auxiliary information 2.  Will not be called with a
    'kind' that uses big segments.

  void sggc_after_marking (int level, int rep)

    Only provided if the application defines SGGC_AFTER_MARKING.

    Performs whatever operations an application needs to do after the
    preliminary marking stage of a garbage collection.  This may
    involve enquiring about which objects have not already been marked
    as in use, using sggc_not_marked, and perhaps indicating that
    further objects are in use by calling sggc_look_at.  

    If any new objects are looked at, sggc_find_object_ptrs will
    be called to trace further references from these objects, and
    sggc_after_marking will then be called again.  

    The arguments to sggc_after_marking give the level of garbage
    collection (0, 1, or 2) and the number of previous times that
    sggc_after_marking was called for this collection (zero the first
    time).
