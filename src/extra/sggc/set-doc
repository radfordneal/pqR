INTRODUCTION

This set facility is designed to support the SGGC functions, but could
be used for other purposes, and hence is documented separately here.

The set facility manages sets of "values", each of which is in a
"segment".  The number of possible values in a segment is fixed and in
the present implementation is limited to a power of two between 8 and
64 (larger values would require new coding and have a performance
cost).  Not all the values allowed in a segment need exist.  Segments
have integer indexes from 0 up, and values within a segment have
offsets that are integers from 0 to the number of possible values in a
segment minus one.  A value within a segment is identified by the pair
of segment index and offset within segment, which must fit in 32 bits
(though expanding this to 64 bits, allowing bigger indexes, would be
possible).

Each set is associated with a "chain", with the restriction that two
sets sharing the same chain must not both contain values that are in
the same segment (see more on this below).  For some purposes, a chain
can be regarded as a set that is the union of all sets sharing that
chain.  The number of chains is intended to be small, and this number
must be fixed at compile time.  The number of sets using these chains
is not restricted, and sets could be dynamically created if desired.

For some operations, the values in a set are ordered.  This ordering
always groups values within one segment together, and the ordering
within a segment is always by numeric offset within the segment.

Each segment is associated with a data structure that contains, for
every chain, a bit vector indicating which values within the segment
are members of some set using that chain, along with the index of a
following segment containing further members of this set (or an end
flag).  The structure describing a set contains the identifier of the
chain it uses, the index of the first segment containing members of
the set (or an end flag, if there are none), and a count of how many
elements are in the set.

Functions are provided for testing for membership in some set that
uses a chain, adding a value to a set, removing a value from a set,
scanning the elements of a set in order, finding the number of
elements in a set, and some other operations.


USING THE SET FACILITY

To use the set facility, an application should create a set-app.h
file, which must start by defining some constants (see below), then
include the set.h file, and conclude with some additional declarations
(see below).

The following constants should be declared with #define at the start
of set-app.h:

  SET_OFFSET_BITS  Number of bits in the "offset" of a value.  Must be
                   3, 4, 5, or 6, corresponding to 8, 16, 32, or 64
                   possible values in a segment.

  SET_CHAINS       Number of chains that may be used for sets.  Must
                   be at least 1.  Larger values will result in 
                   more memory being used for every segment.

  SET_EXTRA_INFO   (optional) If desired, a declaration for additional
                   information that is stored in the structure for a
                   segment.  This might allow space to be used that 
                   would otherwise be wasted as padding for alignment.
                   Should have the form of a structure field, including
                   the terminating semicolon.

For convenience, the application might also at this point define
symbols for the chains, which are identified by integers from 0 to
SET_CHAINS-1, though these symbols would be used only by the
application itself.  Also, the definition of SET_EXTRA_INFO might
involve various other declarations. 

The set.h file should then be included in set-app.h.  It will define
the following types:

  set_offset_t     The type of the offset of a value within a segment.
                   Currently a generic int.  Not used in structures.

  set_index_t      The type of the index used to identify a segment.
                   Currently int32_t.

  set_value_t      The type holding a value - an (index,offset) pair.
                   Currently uint32_t.

  struct set_segment  Structure holding information on a segment.
                      Fields of this should not be accessed directly.

  struct set          Structure holding information on a set.
                      Fields of this should not be accessed directly.

The following constant is also defined in set.h:

  SET_NO_VALUE     A constant of type set_value_t that cannot be an
                   actual value, and hence can be used to indicate
                   the absence of a value.

Finally, the set.h file will declare prototypes (or macros, or static
inline definitions) for the functions documented below.  If set-app.h
defines SET_DO_BEFORE_INLINE, the code it is defined to will be
inserted before any inline function definitions in set.h, but after
all the other declarations.

Before including set.h in set-app.h, the application should declare a
function (or macro), which (if a function) should have the following
prototype:

  struct set_segment *SET_SEGMENT (set_index_t index);

This function (or macro) should return the pointer to the segment
information for the segment with the given index.  It is up to the
application to decide how memory for segment structures is allocated
(eg, a static array, or using an array of pointers to structures
allocated with malloc), and hence how a pointer is found from an
index.  (Note that the actual definition of SET_SEGMENT might need to
be put after set.h is included, as illustrated in test-set/set-app.h,
or in SET_DO_BEFORE_INLINE.)

The set-app.h file should be included in application modules that use
the set facility.  There are two options for how an application
accesses the procedures in set.c.

One method is to separately compile set.c into an object file, and
then link this with modules that use the set facility (or put it in a
library that will be used by such modules).

The other method is to instead include set.c in every source file that
uses the set facility, after including set-app.h, in which case set.c
does not need to be compiled into an object file itself.  (It would
also be possible to include set.c in some modules, while linking
others to the result of compiling set.c.)  The preprocessor symbol
SET_STATIC must be defined as something other than 0 before including
set.c, either by a #define in the source or by a compiler option.
SET_STATIC must be undefined, or defining as 0, when set.c is compiled
separately.

Note that the set facility does not use any persistent variables, so
there is no duplicatation of state from including set.c in more than
one module.  However, memory may be wasted by duplication of code if
set.c is included in many modules.  The advantages of including set.c
rather than linking to it are that the names of the set facility
procedures will be declared "static", avoiding potential name
conflicts, and that an optimizing compiler may be able to produce
faster code when it can see the definitions of the set facility's
procedures (eg, sometimes inlining code).

Whether the set facility tries to use fast builtin functions for
finding and counting 1 bits in a word can be controlled by defining
the SET_USE_BUILTINS pre-processor symbol to be 0 or 1.  If it is not
defined, the builtin functions are used when the gcc or clang
compilers are used (as indicated by __GNUC__ or __clang__ being
defined).


SETS SHARING THE SAME CHAIN

To keep the size of a segment structure small, it is desirable for the
number of chains that are used for sets to be small.  Many sets can
share the same chain provided certain restrictions and assumptions are
satisfied.

First, two sets sharing the same chain must not, at the same time,
contain elements that are values in the same segment.  (This is
because membership of values within one segment is represented by a
single bit vector for each chain, which cannot represent the
memberships of two different sets.)

Furthermore, a set must not even contain an element that is in a
segment if a value in that segment was _previously_ an element of
another set using the same chain, _unless_ that element was removed
from the other chain using the 'remove' option of the set_first
function (and not subsequently added again).

Tests for membership in a set are always actually tests for membership
in any set that uses a given chain - ie, for membership in the union
of all sets sharing the chain.  This may sometimes be what is desired.
Membership in a single set can be determined using set_contains only
if it is guaranteed (by the structure of the application) that the
value cannot be a member of any other set using the same chain.


FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING SET OPERATIONS

The following functions (or macros) are provided by the set facility
for use in an application, with prototypes (if functions) as shown:

  set_value_t SET_VAL (set_index_t index, set_offset_t offset)

    Creates a value that may be an element of a set, from a segment
    index and an offset within this segment.  Before this value can
    be used, the segment with the given index must be initialized 
    with set_segment_init.

  set_index_t SET_VAL_INDEX (set_value_t val)

    Returns the segment index of a value, as was passed to SET_VAL.

  set_offset_t SET_VAL_OFFSET (set_value_t val)

    Returns the offset within its segment of a value, as was passed to
    SET_VAL.

  void set_init (struct set *set, int chain)

    Initializes a set structure, as an empty set that uses the
    indicated chain (which must be between 0 and SET_CHAINS-1).  
    Note that the set must never contain elements with the same
    segment index as elements of any other set using the same chain.

  void set_segment_init (struct set_segment *seg)

    Initializes a segment structure, after which values within this
    segment may be put in sets.  The application is responsible for
    associating segment structures with segment indexes (as is done
    with the SET_SEGMENT function it defines).

  int set_chain (struct set *set);

    Returns the chain used by a set, as was passed to set_init when
    the set was initialized.

  int set_add (struct set *set, set_value_t val)

    Changes 'set' so that it contains 'val' as an element.  Returns 1
    if 'set' had already contained 'val', 0 if not.  Note that 'val'
    must not be added to a set if that set shares its chain with
    another set that contains elements in the same segment as 'val',
    or that previously contained such elements unless they were 
    removed using the 'remove' option of set_first.

  int set_remove (struct set *set, set_value_t val)

    Removes 'val' from 'set', and returns 1 if 'val' was previously in
    'set', and 0 if not.  The caller of remove must ensure that 'val'
    is not a member of any other set using the same chain as 'set'.
    Note that removing all elements in a segment from a set with
    set_remove is not sufficient to permit this segment to be used in
    another set using the same chain.

  int set_contains (struct set *set, set_value_t val)

    Returns 1 if 'val' is an element of any set using the same chain
    as 'set', and 0 otherwise.  Note that a returned value of 1 is
    indicative of membership in 'set' only if it is guaranteed that
    'val' is not a member of any other set using the same chain.

  int set_chain_contains (int chain, set_value_t val)

    Returns 1 if 'val' is an element of any set using 'chain' (ie, is
    a member of the union of all sets using 'chain'), and 0 otherwise.

  int set_chain_contains_any_in_segment (int chain, set_value_t val)

    Returns 1 if any set using 'chain' contains any elements in the
    same segment as 'val'.

  set_value_t set_first (struct set *set, int remove)

    Finds the first element in 'set', returning SET_NO_VALUE if the
    set is empty.  If the 'remove' argument is non-zero, the value
    found is also removed from 'set'.  If the value is removed, and no
    other values from the same segment are elements of 'set', the
    values in this segment may afterward be added to another set that
    uses the same chain as 'set'.

  set_value_t set_next (struct set *set, set_value_t val, int remove)

    Returns the next element of 'set' after 'val', which must be an
    element of 'set.  Returns SET_NO_VALUE if there are no elements
    past 'val'.  If the 'remove' argument is non-zero, 'val' is also
    removed from 'set' (but the element returned is not removed).

    If 'val' is not removed, the value returned (if not SET_NO_VALUE)
    will either be in the same segment as 'val' or in the next
    segment.  This is of relevance if set_move_next will be used.

  set_value_t set_chain_next (int chain, set_value_t val)

    Like set_next, except that the set is specified by a chain ('val'
    must be an element of a set using that chain), and there is no
    option to remove the element.

  set_value_t set_chain_next_segment (int chain, set_value_t val)

    Returns the next element after 'val' that is in a different
    segment, within the set using 'chain' that contains 'val'.  It is
    an error for 'val' not be be in any set using 'chain'.  Returns
    SET_NO_VALUE if there is no such element.

  set_bits_t set_first_bits (struct set *set)

    Returns the bit vector indicating membership of all values in the
    segment of the first element in 'set', with the low-order bit
    being for the value with offset zero.  If 'set' is empty, the
    value returned is zero, which will not be returned otherwise.

  set_bits_t set_chain_segment_bits (int chain, set_value_t val)

    Returns the bit vector indicating membership in a set using
    'chain' of all values in the the segment containing 'val' (which
    must be an element of a set using 'chain').

  void set_assign_segment_bits (struct set *set, set_value_t val, set_bits_t b)

    Sets the bit vector indicating membership in 'set' for the segment
    containing 'val' to the bit vector 'b'.  When set_assign_segment_bits
    is called, 'val' must already be an element of 'set'.  This
    operation has the effect of adding or removing values for which
    the bit at their offset position differs between 'b' and the
    previous vector of bits.  Removing all elements in the segment by
    using 0 for 'b' is allowed.

  void set_move_first (struct set *src, struct set *dst)

    Moves elements in the first segment of one set to another set that
    uses the same chain.  All elements of 'src' that are in the
    segment containing the first element of 'src' are moved to 'dst'
    (becoming its first elements).  It is an error for 'src' to be
    empty, or for 'src' and 'dst' to use different chains.

  void set_move_next (struct set *src, set_value_t val, struct set *dst)

    Moves elements of 'src' in the segment after the segment
    containing 'val' to the front of 'dst'.  It is an error for there
    to be no elements of 'src' after 'val' that are in a different
    segment from 'val', or for 'src' and 'dst' to use different chains.

  void set_add_segment (struct set *set, set_value_t val, int chain)

    Add to 'set' all elements of sets using the given 'chain' that are
    in the same segment as 'val' (which need not be an element of any
    set using 'chain').  The added elements must not be in any other
    set using the same chain as 'set'.

  void set_remove_segment (struct set *set, set_value_t val, int chain)

    Removes from 'set' all elements of sets using the given 'chain'
    that are in the same segment as 'val' (which must be an element of
    'set', but need not be an element of any set using 'chain').  

  set_value_t set_n_elements (struct set *set)

    Returns the number of elements in 'set', zero if the set is empty.
    The return type is set_value_t because this is guaranteed to be a
    large enough integer type (unsigned).

  int set_bit_count (set_bits_t b)

    Returns 1 bits in 'b'.  This is mainly for internal use, but may
    be useful to applications that use set_segment_bits.

  int set_first_bit_pos (set_bits_t b)

    Returns the index of the first (lowest-order) 1 bit in 'b', with
    the bottom bit having index 0.  This is mainly for internal use,
    but may be useful to applications that use set_segment_bits.

All the functions above take O(1) amortized time.
