SEGMENTED GENERATIONAL GARBAGE COLLECTOR

The SGGC library provides a facility for allocating and automatically
freeing objects, such as is needed in interpreters for languages such
as R.  The interface to this facility is documented in sggc-doc.
Documentation on its design and internals is in sggc-imp.

Some tests of SGGC are in test-sggc1, test-sggc2, etc.  They can be
run with run-tests.

As a higher-level test, also useful for performance assessment, an
interpreter for a toy Lisp-like language is in interp, along with
example programs in this language.  The interpreter can be compiled
with various option settings to test these out, as is done in the
Makefile supplied.

A facility used by SGGC for managing sets of values is documented in
set-doc, and tested in test-set, also runnable with run-tests.
