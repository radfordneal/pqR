The helpers library provides facilities by which a "master" thread can
schedule tasks to be done, perhaps by a "helper" thread, or perhaps by
the master itself.  Interaction of the master and helpers is currently
implemented using OpenMP, version 3.0 or 3.1.  This facility can also
be used to improve performance by merging deferred tasks even if
multithreading is not used.

The C interface is defined by helpers.h.  The C routines implementing
the helpers facility are in helpers.c.  Documentation regarding how an
application program should use this facility is in the file api-doc.
The file imp-doc has information on how the facility is implemented.

The "examples" directory contains example programs that demonstrate
many of the features.  See the README in that directory for details.
