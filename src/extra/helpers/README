The helpers library provides facilities by which a "master" thread can
schedule tasks to be done, perhaps by a "helper" thread, or perhaps by
the master itself.  Interaction of the master and helpers is currently
implemented using OpenMP, version 3.0 or 3.1.

The C interface is defined by helpers.h.  The C routines implementing
the helpers facility are in helpers.c.  Documentation regarding how an
application program should use this facility is in the file api-doc.
The file imp-doc has information on how the facility is implemented.

The "examples" directory contains example programs that demonstrate
many of the features.  See the README in that directory for details.
