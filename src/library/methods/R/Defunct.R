## old access functions that do nothing but get a slot
## likely to be made defunct & disappear.

## The above comment is there since May 2003, R 1.8.0
## similarly in the help file ../man/oldGet.Rd
## Finally (2008-02) made deprecated formally for 2.7.0, defunct in 2.8.0 -- removed for 4.0.0 --

## getAccess <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getClassName <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getClassPackage <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getExtends <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getProperties <- function (ClassDef)  .Defunct()

## getPrototype <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getSubclasses <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## getVirtual <- function (ClassDef) .Defunct()

## Deprecated in 2.7.0, defunct in 2.8.0 -- removed for 4.0.0 ----------------------

## getAllMethods <- function(f, fdef, where = topenv(parent.frame())) .Defunct()

## mlistMetaName <- function(name = "", package = "") .Defunct()

## removeMethodsObject <- function(f, where = topenv(parent.frame())) .Defunct()

## seemsS4Object <- function(object) .Defunct("isS4")

## Deprecated in 2.8.0, defunct in 2.9.0 -- removed in 4.0.0 ----------------------

## allGenerics <- function(...)
##     ## this is used nowhere, and we already have too many functions
##     .Defunct("getGenerics")

## Deprecated in 3.4.0, defunct in 3.5.0:

bind_activation <- function(on = TRUE)
{
    stop("methods:::bind_activation() is defunct;\n rather provide methods for cbind2() / rbind2()")
}
