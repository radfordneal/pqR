\title{Adjust P-values for Multiple Comparisons}
\description{Given a set of p-values, returns p-values adjusted using
  one of several methods.}
\usage{
p.adjust(p, method = p.adjust.methods, n = length(p))

p.adjust.methods
# c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY",
#   "fdr", "none")
}
\arguments{
  \item{p}{numeric vector of p-values (possibly with
    \code{\link{NA}}s).  Any other \R object is coerced by
    \code{\link{as.numeric}}.}
  \item{method}{correction method, a \code{\link{character}} string.
    Can be abbreviated.}
  \item{n}{number of comparisons, must be at least \code{length(p)};
    only set this (to non-default) when you know what you are doing!}
}
\details{
  The adjustment methods include the Bonferroni correction
  (\code{"bonferroni"}) in which the p-values are multiplied by the
  number of comparisons.  Less conservative corrections are also
  included by Holm (1979) (\code{"holm"}), Hochberg (1988)
  (\code{"hochberg"}), Hommel (1988) (\code{"hommel"}), Benjamini &
  Hochberg (1995) (\code{"BH"} or its alias \code{"fdr"}), and Benjamini &
  Yekutieli (2001) (\code{"BY"}), respectively.
  A pass-through option (\code{"none"}) is also included.
  The set of methods are contained in the \code{p.adjust.methods} vector
  for the benefit of methods that need to have the method as an option
  and pass it on to \code{p.adjust}.

  The first four methods are designed to give strong control of the
  family-wise error rate.  There seems no reason to use the unmodified
  Bonferroni correction because it is dominated by Holm's method, which
  is also valid under arbitrary assumptions.

  Hochberg's and Hommel's methods are valid when the hypothesis tests
  are independent or when they are non-negatively associated (Sarkar,
  1998; Sarkar and Chang, 1997).  Hommel's method is more powerful than
  Hochberg's, but the difference is usually small and the Hochberg
  p-values are faster to compute.

  The \code{"BH"} (aka \code{"fdr"}) and \code{"BY"} methods of
  Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli control the false discovery rate,
  the expected proportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected
  hypotheses.  The false discovery rate is a less stringent condition
  than the family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful
  than the others.

  Note that you can set \code{n} larger than \code{length(p)} which
  means the unobserved p-values are assumed to be greater than all the
  observed p for \code{"bonferroni"} and \code{"holm"} methods and equal
  to 1 for the other methods.

require(graphics)

set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(50, mean = c(rep(0, 25), rep(3, 25)))

## or all of them at once (dropping the "fdr" alias):

p.adj    <- sapply(p.adjust.M, function(meth) p.adjust(p, meth))
p.adj.60 <- sapply(p.adjust.M, function(meth) p.adjust(p, meth, n = 60))
stopifnot(identical(p.adj[,"none"], p), p.adj <= p.adj.60)
round(p.adj, 3)
## or a bit nicer:
noquote(apply(p.adj, 2, format.pval, digits = 3))


## and a graphic:
matplot(p, p.adj, ylab="p.adjust(p, meth)", type = "l", asp = 1, lty = 1:6,
        main = "P-value adjustments")
legend(0.7, 0.6, p.adjust.M, col = 1:6, lty = 1:6)

## Can work with NA's:
pN <- p; iN <- c(46, 47); pN[iN] <- NA
pN.a <- sapply(p.adjust.M, function(meth) p.adjust(pN, meth))
## The smallest 20 P-values all affected by the NA's :
round((pN.a / p.adj)[1:20, ] , 4)
