\title{
  Report Configuration Options for PCRE
}
\description{
  Report some of the configuration options of the version of PCRE in use
  in this \R session.
}
\usage{
pcre_config()
}
\value{
  A named logical vector, currently with elements
  \item{UTF-8}{Support for UTF-8 inputs.  Required.}
  \item{Unicode properties}{Support for \samp{\p{xx}} and \samp{\P{xx}}
    in regular expressions.  Desirable and used by some CRAN packages.
    As of PCRE2, always present with support for UTF-8.}
  \item{JIT}{Support for just-in-time compilation.  Desirable for speed
    (but only available as a compile-time option on certain
    architectures).}
  \item{stack}{Does match recursion use a stack (\code{TRUE}, the default
    for PCRE1 and PCRE2 older than 10.30) or a heap?  See the discussion at
    \url{http://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrestack.html}  (Added
    in \R 3.4.0.). No longer relevant and always \code{FALSE} in PCRE2
    since version 10.30 which no longer uses function recursion to remember
    backtracking positions.}
