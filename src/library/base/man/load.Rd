\title{Reload Saved Datasets}
\description{
  Reload datasets written with the function \code{save}.
}
\usage{
load(file, envir = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a (readable binary-mode) \link{connection} or a character string
    giving the name of the file to load (when \link{tilde expansion}
    is done).}
  \item{envir}{the environment where the data should be loaded.}
}
\details{
  \code{load} can load \R objects saved in the current pqR
  format (version 2), but not objects saved in the format used before R 1.4.0,
  or in the default format of some later R core versions.  It can read 
  a compressed file (see \code{\link{save}})
  directly from a file or from a suitable connection (including a call
  to \code{\link{url}}).
  
  A not-open connection will be opened in mode \code{"rb"} and closed
  after use.  Any connection other than a \code{\link{gzfile}} or
  \code{\link{gzcon}} connection will be wrapped in \code{\link{gzcon}}
  to allow compressed saves to be handled: note that this leaves the
  connection in an altered state (in particular, binary-only), and that
  it needs to be closed explicitly (it will not be garbage-collected).
  
  Only \R objects saved in the current pqR format (version 2)
  can be read from a connection.  If no input is available on a
  connection a warning will be given, but any input not in the current
  format will result in a error.
}
\value{
  A character vector of the names of objects created, invisibly.
}
\section{Warning}{
  Saved \R objects are binary files, even those saved with
  \code{ascii = TRUE}, so ensure that they are transferred without
  conversion of end of line markers.  \code{load} tries to detect such a
  conversion and gives an informative error message.
}
#ifdef windows
\note{
  \code{file} can be a UTF-8-encoded filepath that cannot be translated to
  the current locale.

\examples{
## save all data
xx <- pi # to ensure there is some data
save(list = ls(all=TRUE), file= "all.RData")
rm(xx)

## restore the saved values to the current environment
local({
   load("all.RData")
   ls()
})
## restore the saved values to the user's workspace
load("all.RData", .GlobalEnv)

unlink("all.RData")

\dontrun{
con <- url("http://some.where.net/R/data/example.rda")
## print the value to see what objects were created.
print(load(con))
close(con) # url() always opens the connection
