 * Windows CJK
 * In Unicode, there is not a rule about character width. 
 * A letter of breadth is used in a CJK (China, Japan, Korea,
 * Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) area, and there are a
 * letter and a standard (character width is not still prescribed)
 * of a cord in a country.
 * Letter width is a problem of a font, but it is a rule route
 * besides a alphanumeric character that use a breadth letter.
 * It is generally defined as a breadth letter for a font such
 * as Japanese.
 * - Win32

 *  Attempted explanation by BDR
 *  The display widths of characters are not prescribed in Unicode.
 *  Double-width characters are used in the CJK area: their width can
 *  be font-specific, with different fonts in use in different parts
 *  of the CJK area.  The tables supplied in many OSes and by Markus
 *  Kuhn are not do not take the exact locale into account.  The
 *  tables supplied in rlocale_data.h allow different widths for
 *  different parts of the CJK area, and also where needed different
 *  widths on Windows.  (The Windows differences are in zh_CN, and
 *  apply to European characters.)
 *
 * The differences are mainly (but not exclusively) in the
 * Unicode 'East Asian Ambiguous' class.
