<h2> pqR News</h2>

<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-10-18</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a minor update to the release of 2014-09-30, with fixes
for a few problems, and a few performance improvements.  Packages
installed for pqR-2014-09-30 do not need to be reinstalled for
this release.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION, BUILDING, AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A new test (var-lookup.R) for correctness of local vs. global symbol 
bindings has been added, which is run with other tests done by 
&quot;make check&quot;.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The documentation on &quot;contexts&quot; in the R Internals manual has
been updated to relect a change made in pqR-2014-09-30.  (This
manual has also been updated to reflect the change below.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Lookup of functions now often skips local environments that
were previously found not to contain the symbol being looked up.
In particular, this speeds up calls of base functions that are
not already fast due to their being recognized as &quot;special&quot; symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The set of &quot;special&quot; symbols for which lookups in local environments
is usually particularly fast now includes <code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>,
<code>.Call</code>, <code>.External</code>, and <code>.Internal</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (pqR issue #27) in which a user-defined replacement
might get an argument that is not marked as shared, which 
could cause anomalous behaviour in some circumstances.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed an issue with passing on variant return requests to function
bodies (though it's hard to construct an example where this issue
produces incorrect results).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> [ Actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted from NEWS. ]
Fixed problems with calls of <code>strncpy</code> that were described in
PR #15990 at r-project.org.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-09-30</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release contains several major performance improvements.  Notably,
lookup of variables will sometimes be much faster, variable updates
like <code>v &lt;- v + 1</code> will often not allocate any new space,
assignments to parts of variables (eg, <code>a[i] &lt;- 0)</code> is much faster
in the interpreter (no change for byte-compiled code), external
functions called with <code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code> now get faster
macro or inline versions of functions such as <code>CAR</code>, <code>LENGTH</code>,
and <code>REAL</code>, and calling of external functions with <code>.C</code> and 
<code>.Fortran</code> is substantially  faster, and can sometimes be done in 
a helper thread.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changes have been made to configuration options regarding use of BLAS
routines for matrix multiplication, as described below.  In part, these
changes are intended to made the default be close to what R Core 
releases do (but without the unnecessary inefficiency).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A number of updates from R Core releases after R-2.15.0 have 
been incorporated or adapted for use in pqR.  These provide some 
performance improvements, some new features or feature changes, and 
some bug fixes and documentation updates.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many other feature changes and performance improvements have also
been made, as described below, and a number of bugs have been fixed,
some of which are also present in the latest R Core release, R-3.1.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Packages using <code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code> should be re-installed
for use with this version of pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option, which controls whether the
BLAS routines or pqR's C routines are used for matrix multiplication,
may now be set to <code>NA</code>, which is equivalent to <code>FALSE</code>,
except that for multiplication of sufficiently large matrices (not
vector-vector, vector-matrix, or matrix-vector multiplication) pqR 
will use a BLAS routine unless there is an element in one of the 
operands that is <code>NA</code> or <code>NaN</code>.  This mimics the behaviour 
of R Core implementations (at least through 3.1.1), which is motivated
by a desire to ensure that <code>NA</code> is propagated correctly even
if the BLAS does not do so, but avoids the substantial but needless 
inefficiency present in the R Core implementation.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>BLAS_in_helpers</code> option now allows run-time control of
whether BLAS routines may be done in a helper thread. (But this
will be fixed at <code>FALSE</code> if that is set as the default when
pqR is built.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>codePromises</code> option has been added to <code>deparse</code>,
and documented in <code>help(.deparseOpts)</code>.  With this option,
the deparsed expression uses the code part of a promise, not
the value, similarly to the existing <code>delayPromises</code>
option, but without the extra text that that option produces.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This new <code>codePromises</code> deparse option is now used when producing
error messages and traceback output.  This improves error messages
in the new scheme for subset assignments (see the section on
performance improvements below), and also avoids the voluminous
output previously produced in circumstances such as the following:
</p>
<PRE>   `f&lt;-` &lt;- function (x,value) x[1,1] &lt;- value
   a &lt;- 1
   f(a) &lt;- rep(123,1000)  # gives an error
   traceback()
</PRE>
This previously produced output with 1000 repetitions of 123
in the traceback produced following the error message.  The traceback
now instead shows the expression <code>rep(123,1000)</code>.
</li>
<li><p> The <code>evaluate</code> option for <code>dump</code> has been extended to
allow access to the new <code>codePromises</code> deparse option.
See <code>help(dump)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The formal arguments of primitive functions will now be returned
by <code>formals</code>, as they are shown when printed or with <code>args</code>.
In R Core releases (at least to R-3.1.1), the result of <code>formals</code>
for a primitive is <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the <code>deparse.max.lines</code> option will now limit the
number of lines printed when exiting debug of a function, as
well as when entering.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code>, arguments may be character strings
even when <code>DUP=FALSE</code> is specified - they are duplicated regardless.
This differs from R Core versions, which (at least through R-3.1.1)
give an error if an argument is a character string and <code>DUP=FALSE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code>, scalars (vectors of length one)
are duplicated (in effect, though not necessarily physically) even 
when <code>DUP=FALSE</code> is specified.  However, they are not duplicated 
in R Core versions (at least through R-3.1.1), 
so it may be unwise to rely on this.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>HELPER</code> argument can now be used in <code>.C</code> and 
<code>.Fortran</code> to specify that the C or Fortran routine may
(sometimes) be done in a helper thread.  (See the section on
performance improvements below.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: The unary <code>+</code> operator now converts a logical vector
to an integer vector.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: Support for &quot;converters&quot; for use with <code>.C</code> has been 
dropped.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
<code>pmin()</code> and <code>pmax())</code> now also work when one of the inputs 
is of length zero and others are not, returning a zero-length vector,
analogously to, say, <code>+</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
.C() gains some protection against the misuse of character vector
arguments.  (An all too common error is to pass character(N),
which initializes the elements to &quot;&quot;, and then attempt to edit
the strings in-place, sometimes forgetting to terminate them.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
Calls to the new function globalVariables() in package utils
declare that functions and other objects in a package should be
treated as globally defined, so that CMD check will not note
them.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
print(packageDescription(*)) trims the Collate field by default.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: A new option &quot;show.error.locations&quot; has been added.  
When set to
TRUE, error messages will contain the location of the most recent
call containing source reference information. (Other values are
supported as well; see ?options.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
C entry points R_GetCurrentSrcref and R_GetSrcFilename have been
added to the API to allow debuggers access to the source
references on the stack.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION, BUILDING, TESTING, AND DEBUGGING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>--enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS</code> configuration
option has been replaced by the ability to use a configure 
argument of <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE</code>, <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE</code>,
or <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=NA</code>, to set the default value of this
option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers</code> configuration
option has been replaced by the ability to use a configure 
argument of <code>BLAS_in_helpers=FALSE</code> or <code>BLAS_in_helpers=TRUE</code>
to set the default value of this option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The LAPACK routines used are now the same as those in R-3.1.1 (version
3.5.0).
However, the <code>.Call</code> interface to these remains as in 
R-2.15.0 to R-2.15.3 (it was changed to use <code>.Internal</code> in R-3.0.0).
Since LAPACK 3.5.0 uses some more recent Fortran features, a 
Fortran 77 compiler such as <code>g77</code> will no longer suffice.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the environment variable <code>R_ABORT</code> to any non-null
string will prevent any attempt to produce a stack trace on a
segmentation fault, in favour of instead producing (maybe) an
immediate core dump.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The variable <code>R_BIT_BUCKET</code> in &lsquo;<span class="file">share/make/vars.mk</span>&rsquo;
now specifies a file to receive output that is normally ignored
when building pqR.  It is set to &lsquo;<span class="file">dev/null</span>&rsquo; in the distribution,
but this can be changed to help diagnose build problems.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The C functions <code>R_inspect</code> and <code>R_inspect3</code> functions are now
visible to package code, so they can be used there for debugging.
To see what they do, look in &lsquo;<span class="file">src/main/inspect.c</span>&rsquo;.  They are subject
to change, and should not appear in any code released to users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>Rf_error</code> and related procedures declared in 
&lsquo;<span class="file">R_ext/Error.h</span>&rsquo; are now if possible declared to never return,
allowing for slightly better code generation by the compiler, 
and avoiding spurious compiler warnings.  This parallels a change 
in R-3.0.1, but is more general, using the C11 noreturn facility if 
present, and otherwise resorting to the gcc facility (if gcc is used).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION FEATURES LIKE THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
install.packages(&quot;pkg_version.tgz&quot;) on Mac OS X now has sanity
checks that this is actually a binary package (as people have
tried it with incorrectly named source packages).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2: <code>--with-blas='-framework vecLib'</code> now also works
on OS X 10.8 and 10.9.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3:
Configuration and R CMD javareconf now come up with a smaller set
of library paths for Java on Oracle-format JDK (including
OpenJDK).  This helps avoid conflicts between libraries (such as
libjpeg) supplied in the JDK and system libraries.  This can
always be overridden if needed: see the 'R Installation and
Administration' manual.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3:
The configure tests for Objective C and Objective C++ now work on
Mac OS 10.8 with Xcode 4.5.2 (PR#15107).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The cairo-based versions of <code>X11()</code> now work with
current versions of cairographics (e.g. 1.12.10).  (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15168">PR#15168</a>)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>


<p>These are in addition to changes in documentation relating to other
changes reported here.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Some incorrect code has been corrected in the &quot;Writing
R Extensions&quot; manual, in the &quot;Zero finding&quot;
and &quot;Calculating numerical derivatives&quot; sections.  The
discussion in &quot;Finding and Setting Variables&quot; has also been
clarified to reflect current behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Documentation in the &quot;R Internals&quot; manual has been updated
to reflect recent changes in pqR regarding symbols and variable
lookup, and to remove incorrect information about the global cache
present in the version from R-2.15.0 (and R-3.1.1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed an out-of-date comment in the section on helper threads in
the &quot;R Internals&quot; manual.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>


<p>Numerous improvements in speed and memory usage have been made in this
release of pqR.  Some of these are noted here.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Lookup of local variables is now usually much faster (especially when
the number of local variables is large), since for each symbol,
the last local binding found is now recorded, usually avoiding a 
linear search through local symbol bindings.  Those lookups that are
still needed are also now a bit faster, due to unrolling of the 
search loop.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments to selected parts of variables (eg, <code>a[i,j] &lt;- 0</code> or
<code>names(L$a[[f()]]) &lt;- v</code>) are now much faster in the interpreter.
(Such assignments within functions that are byte-compiled use a 
different mechanism that has not been changed in this release.)  
</p>
<p>This change also alters the error 
messages produced from such assignments.  They are probably not as 
informative (at least to unsophisticated users) as those that
the interpreter produced previously, though they are better than 
those produced from byte-compiled code.  On the plus side, the error 
messages are now consistent for primitive and user-written replacement 
functions, and some messages now contain short, intelligible expressions
that could previously contain huge amounts of data (see the section on 
new features above).  
</p>
<p>This change also fixes the anomaly that arguments
of subset expressions would sometimes be evaluated more than once
(eg, <code>f()</code> in the example above).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code> has been substantially
improved, partly by incorporating changes in R-2.15.1 and R-2.15.2,
but with substantial additional improvements as well.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>.Call</code> and <code>.External</code> has been improved somewhat.
More importantly, the C routines called will get macro versions of 
<code>CAR</code>, <code>CDR</code>, <code>CADR</code>, etc., macro versions of <code>TYPEOF</code>
and <code>LENGTH</code>, and inline function versions of <code>INTEGER</code>,
<code>LOGICAL</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, and <code>RAW</code>.  This
avoidance of procedure call overhead for these operations may speed
up some C procedures substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In some circumstances, a routine called with <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>
can now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other computations.
This is done only if requested with the <code>HELPER</code> option, and
at present only in certain limited circumstances, in which only a single
output variable is used.  See <code>help(.C)</code> or <code>help(.Fortran)</code>
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> As an initial use of the previous feature, the <code>findInterval</code> 
function now will sometimes execute its C routine in a helper thread.
(More significant uses of the <code>HELPER</code> option to <code>.C</code> and
<code>.Fortran</code> will follow in later releases.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments that update a local variable by applying a single unary or 
binary mathematical operation will now often re-use space for
the variable that is updated, rather than allocating new space.
For example, this will be done with all the assignments in the
second line below:
</p>
<PRE>   u &lt;- rep(1,1000); v &lt;- rep(2,1000); w &lt;- exp(2)
   u &lt;- exp(u); u &lt;- 2*u; v &lt;- v/2; u &lt;- u+v; w &lt;- w+1
</PRE>
This modification also has the effect of increasing the possibilities
for task merging.  For example, in the above code, the first two
updates for <code>u</code> will be merged into one computation that sets
<code>u</code> to <code>2*exp(u)</code> using a single loop over the vector.
</li>
<li><p> The performance of <code>rep</code> and <code>rep.int</code> is much improved.
These improvements (and improvements previously made in pqR) go beyond 
those in R Core releases from R-2.15.2 on, so these functions are often 
substantially faster in pqR than in R-2.15.2 or later R Core versions
to at least R-3.1.1, for both long and short vectors.  (However, note
that the changes in functionality made in R-2.15.2 have not been made 
in pqR; in particular, pairlists are still allowed, as in R-2.15.0.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For numeric vectors, the repetition done by <code>rep</code> and <code>rep.int</code>
may now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other computations.
For example, attaching names to the result of <code>rep</code> (if necessary)
may be done in parallel with replication of the data part.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The amount of space used on the C stack has been reduced, with the
result that deeper recursion is possible within a given C stack
limit.  For example, the following is now possible with the default
stack limit (at least on one Intel Linux system with gcc 4.6.3, results
will vary with platform):
</p>
<PRE>   f &lt;- function (n) { if (n&gt;0) 1+f(n-1) else 0 }
   options(expressions=500000)
   f(7000)
</PRE>
For comparison, with pqR-2014-06-1, and R-3.1.1, trying to evaluate 
f(3100) gives a C stack overflow error (but f(3000) works).
</li>
<li><p> Expressions now sometimes return constant values, that are shared,
and likely stored in read-only memory.  These constants include 
<code>NULL</code>, the scalars (vectors of length one) <code>FALSE</code>, 
<code>TRUE</code>, <code>NA</code>, <code>NA_real_</code>, 0.0, 1.0, 0L, 1L, ..., 10L, 
and some one-element pairlists with such constant elements.  Apart 
from <code>NULL</code>, these constants are not
<EM>always</EM> used for the corresponding value, but they often are, which
saves on memory and associated garbage collection time.  External routines
that incorrectly modify objects without checking that <code>NAMED</code> is
zero may now crash when passed a read-only constant, which is a generally
desirable debugging aid, though it might sometimes cause a package that
had previously at least sort-of worked to no longer run.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>substr</code> function has been sped up, and uses less memory,
especially when a small substring is extracted from a long string.
Assignment to <code>substr</code> has also been sped up a bit.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The function for unserializing data (eg, reading file &lsquo;<span class="file">.RData</span>&rsquo;) is
now done with elimination of tail-recursion (on the CDR field) when 
reading pairlists.  This is both faster and less likely to produce a stack
overflow.  Some other improvements to serializing/unserializing have
also been made, including support for restoring constant values (mentioned
above) as constant values.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Lookup of S3 methods has been sped up, especially when no method is
found.  This is important for several primitive functions, such as 
<code>$</code>, that look for a method when applied to an object with a class
attribute, but perform the operation themselves if no method is found.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Integer plus, minus, and times are now somewhat faster (a side effect
of switching to a more robust overflow check, as described below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Several improvements relating to garbage collection have been made.
One change is that the amount of memory used for each additional
symbol has been reduced from 112 bytes (two CONS cells) to 80 bytes
(on 64-bit platforms), not counting the space for the symbol's name
(a minumum of 48 bytes on 64-bit platforms).  Another change is in 
tuning of heap sizes, in order to reduce occasions in which garbage 
collection is very frequent.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many uses of the <code>return</code> statement have been sped up.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Functions in the <code>apply</code> family have been sped up when they are
called with no additional arguments for the function being applied.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The performance problem reported in PR #15798 at r-project.org has
been fixed (differently from the R Core fix).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A performance bug has been fixed in which any assignment to a vector 
subscripted with a string index caused the entire vector to be copied.
For example, the final assignment in the code below would copy all
of <code>a</code>:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-rep(1.1,10000); names(a)[1] &lt;- "x"
   a["x"] &lt;- 9
</PRE>
This bug exists in R Core implementations though at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> A performance bug has been fixed that involved subscripting with many 
invalid string indexes, reported on r-devel on 2010-07-15 and 
2013-05-8.  It is illustrated by the following code, 
which was more than ten thousand times slower than expected:
</p>
<PRE>   x &lt;- c(A=10L, B=20L, C=30L)
   subscript &lt;- c(LETTERS[1:3], sprintf("ID%05d", 1:150000))
   system.time(y1 &lt;- x[subscript])
</PRE>
The fix in this version of pqR does not solve the related problem 
when assigning to <code>x[subscript]</code>, which is still slow.  Fixing
that would require implementation of a new method, possibly requiring
more memory.
This performance bug exists in R Core releases through R-3.1.1, but
may now be fixed (differently) in the current R Core development version.
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>numericDeriv</code> (see also the documentation
update above), which is illustrated by the following
code, which gave the wrong derivative:
</p>
<PRE>    x &lt;- y &lt;- 10
    numericDeriv(quote(x+y),c("x","y"))
</PRE>
I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed (differently) in
R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem in <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code> where, contrary
to the documentation (except when <code>DUP=TRUE</code> and no duplication 
was actually needed), logical values after the call other than 
<code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, and <code>NA</code> are not mapped to <code>TRUE</code>,
but instead exist as invalid values that may show up later.
This bug exists in R Core versions 2.15.1 through at least 3.1.1.
I reported it as <a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15878">PR#15878</a> at r-project.org, so it may be fixed in
a later R Core release.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with treatment of <code>ANYSXP</code> in specifying
types of registered C or Fortran routines, which in particular had
prevented the types of <code>str_signif</code>, used in <code>formatC</code>,
from being registered.  (This bug exists in R Core versions of R
at least through R-3.1.1.) 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>substr</code> applied to a string with UTF-8
encoding, which could cause a crash for code such as
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- "\xc3\xa9"
   Encoding(a) &lt;- "UTF-8"
   b &lt;- paste0(rep(a,8000),collapse="")
   c &lt;- substr(b,1,16000)
</PRE>
I reported this as PR15910 at r-project.org, so it may be
fixed in an R Core release after R-3.1.1.  A related bug in
assignment to <code>substr</code> has also been fixed.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in how debugging is handled that is illustrated by the
following output:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; g &lt;- function () { A &lt;&lt;- A+1; function (x) x+1 }
   &gt; f &lt;- function () (g())(10)
   &gt; A &lt;- 0; f(); print(A)
   [1] 11
   [1] 1
   &gt; debug(f);
   &gt; A &lt;- 0; f(); print(A)
   debugging in: f()
   debug: (g())(10)
   Browse[2]&gt; c
   exiting from: f()
   [1] 11
   [1] 2
</PRE>
Note that the final value of <code>A</code> is different (and wrong) when
<code>f</code> is stepped through in the debugger.  This bug exists in
R Core releases through at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following code, which gave
an error saying that <code>p[1,1]</code> has the wrong number of subscripts:
</p>
<PRE>   p &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3,4); dim(p) &lt;- c(2,2); p[1,1] &lt;- 9
</PRE>
This bug exists in R Core releases through at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following pqR bug (and related bugs), in which
<code>b</code> was modified by the assignment to <code>a</code>:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(list(1+1))
   b &lt;- a
   attr(a[[1]][[1]],"fred")&lt;-9
   print(b)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug in which <code>b</code> was modified
by an assignment to <code>a</code> with a vector subscript:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(list(mk2(1)))
   b &lt;- a[[1]]
   a[[c(1,1)]][1] &lt;- 3
   print(b)
</PRE>
This bug also exists in R-2.15.0, but was fixed in R-3.1.1 
(quite differently than in pqR).
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of error checking bug that could cause expressions
such as <code>match.call(,expression())</code> to crash from an
invalid memory reference.  This bug also exists in R-2.15.0 and
R-3.1.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the non-robust checks for integer overflow, which reportedly
sometimes fail when using clang on a Mac.  This is #PR 15774 at
r-project.org, fixed in R-3.1.1, but fixed differently in pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug with expressions of the form <code>t(x)%*%y</code>
when <code>y</code> is an S4 object.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (PR #15399 at r-project.og) in <code>na.omit</code> and 
<code>na.exclude</code> that led to a
data frame that should have had zero rows having one row instead.
(Also fixed in R-3.1.1, though differently.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the problem that RStudio crashed whenever a function was
debugged (with <code>debug</code>).  This was due to pqR having changed
the order of fields in the <code>RCNTXT</code> structure, which is an
internal data structure of the interpreter, but is nevertheless
accessed in RStudio.  The order of fields is now back to what it was.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the bug in <code>nlm</code> reported as PR #15958
at r-project.org, along with related bugs in <code>uniroot</code> and
<code>optimize</code>.  These all involve situations where the function
being optimized saves its argument in some manner, and then sees
the saved value change when the optimizer re-uses the space for the 
argument on the next call.  The fix made is to no longer reuse the 
space, which will unfortunately cause a (fairly small) decline in 
performance.
</p>
<p>The <code>optim</code> function also has this problem, but only
when numerical derivatives are used.  It has not yet been fixed.
The <code>integrate</code> function does not seem to have a problem.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in the code to check for C stack overflow, that may
show up when the fallback method for determining the start of the
stack is needed, and a stack check is then done when very little stack
is in use, resulting in an erroneous report of stack overflow.  The
problem is platform dependent, but arises on a SPARC Solaris system 
when using gcc 3.4.3, once stack usage is reduced by the improvement
described above, leading to failure of one of the tests for package 
Matrix.  This bug exists in R Core version back to 2.11.1 (or earlier)
and up to at least 3.1.1.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: 
Trying to update (recommended) packages in R_HOME/library without
write access is now dealt with more gracefully.  Further, such
package updates may be skipped (with a warning), when a newer
installed version is already going to be used from .libPaths().
(PR#14866)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
<CODE>R CMD check</CODE> with <span class="env">_R_CHECK_NO_RECOMMENDED_</span>
set to a true value (as done by the <CODE>--as-cran</CODE> option)
could issue false errors if there was an indirect dependency
on a recommended package.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
getMethod(f, sig) produced an incorrect error message in some
cases when f was not a string).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2:
In Windows, the GUI preferences for foreground color were 
not always respected.  (Reported by Benjamin Wells.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The evaluator now keeps track of source references outside of
functions, e.g. when source() executes a script.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The value returned by tools::psnice() for invalid pid values was
not always NA as documented.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2:
<code>sort.list(method = "radix")</code> could give incorrect
results on certain compilers (seen with <CODE>clang</CODE> on Mac OS
10.7 and <CODE>Xcode 4.4.1</CODE>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1:
Calling <code>file.copy()</code> or <code>dirname()</code> with the
invalid input <code>""</code> (which was being used in packages, despite
not being a file path) could have caused a segfault.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1:
<code>dirname("")</code> is now <code>""</code> rather than <code>"."</code> (unless
it segfaulted).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Similarly to R-3.1.1-patched:
In package <code>parallel</code>, child processes now call <code>_Exit</code>
rather than <code>exit</code>, so that the main process is not affected
by flushing of input/output buffers in the child.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-06-19</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, documentation
improvements (including provision of previously missing
documentation), and changes for compatibility with R Core releases.
There are some new features in this release that help
with testing pqR and packages. There are no significant changes 
in performance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the sections below on earlier releases for general
information on pqR.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that there was a test release of 2014-06-10 that 
is superceded by this release, with no separate listing 
of the changes it contained.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES FOR TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The setting of the <code>R_SEED</code> environment variable now specifies what
random number seed to use when <code>set.seed</code> is not called.  When
<code>R_SEED</code> is not set, the seed will be set from the time and process
ID as before.  It is recommended that <code>R_SEED</code> be set before running
tests on pqR or packages, so that the results will be reproducible.
For example, some packages report an error if a hypothesis test on
simulated data results in a p-value less than some threshold.  If 
<code>R_SEED</code> is not set, these packages will fail their tests now 
and then at random, whereas setting <code>R_SEED</code> will result either
in consistent success or (less likely) consistent failure.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The comparison of test output with saved output using <code>Rdiff</code> now
ignores any output from <code>valgrind</code>, so spurious errors will not be
triggered by using it.  When using <code>valgrind</code>, the
output files should be checked manually for <code>valgrind</code> messages 
that are of possible interest.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The test script in &lsquo;<span class="file">tests/internet.R</span>&rsquo; no longer looks at CRAN's html
code, which is subject to change.  It instead looks at a special test file
at <a href="pqR-project.org">pqR-project.org</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed problems wit the &lsquo;<span class="file">reg-tests-1b</span>&rsquo; test script.  Also, now sets
the random seed, so it's consistent (even without R_SEED set), and has
its output compared to a saved version.  Non-fatal errors (with
code 5) should be expected on systems without enough memory for xz
compression.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>CHANGE FOR COMPATIBILITY</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The result of <code>diag(list(1,3,5))</code> is now a matrix of type
double.  In R-2.15.0, this expression did not produce a sensible
result.  A previous fix in pqR made this expression produce a matrix of 
type list.  A later change by R Core also fixed this, but so it
produced a double matrix, coercing the list to a numeric vector
(to the extent possible); pqR now does the same.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The documentation for <code>c</code> now says how the names for the 
result are determined, including previously missing information
on the <code>use.names</code> argument, and on the role of the names of
arguments in the call of <code>c</code>.  This documentation is missing
in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentaton for <code>diag</code> now documents that a diagonal matrix 
is always created with type double or complex, and that the
names of an extracted diagonal vector are taken from a <code>names</code>
attribute (if present), if not from the row and column names.  This
information is absent in the documentation in R-2.15.1 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Incorrect information regarding the pointer protection stack
was removed from <code>help(Memory)</code>.  This incorrect information
is present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0 as well.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is now information in <code>help(Arithmetic)</code> regarding what
happens when the operands of an arithmetic operation are <code>NA</code>
or <code>NaN</code>, including the arbitrary nature of the result when
one operand is <code>NA</code> and the other is <code>NaN</code>.  There is
no discussion of this issue in the documentation for R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>R_HELPERS</code> and <code>R_HELPERS_TRACE</code> environment variables
are now documented in <code>help("environment variables")</code>.  The
documentation in <code>help(helpers)</code> has also been clarified.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>R_DEBUGGER</code> and <code>R_DEBUGGER_ARGS</code> environment variables
are now documented in <code>help("environment variables")</code> as 
alternatives to the <code>--debugger</code> and <code>--debugger-args</code>
arguments.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed lack of protection bugs in the <code>equal</code> and <code>greater</code>
functions in &lsquo;<span class="file">sort.c</span>&rsquo;.  These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0
and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed lack of protection bugs in the <code>D</code> function in &lsquo;<span class="file">deriv.c</span>&rsquo;.
These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed argument error-checking bugs in <code>getGraphicsEventEnv</code>
and <code>setGraphicsEventEnv</code> (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a stack imbalance bug that shows up in the expression
<code>anyDuplicated(c(1,2,1),incomp=2)</code>.  This bug is also present
in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.  The bug is reported only when the <code>base</code>
package is not byte compiled (but still exists silently when it is 
compiled).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in the foreign package that showed up on systems where
the C <code>char</code> type is unsigned, such as a Rasberry Pi running
Rasbian.  I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed in R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of protection bug that arose when <code>log</code> produced a
warning.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of protection bug in the <code>lang[23456]</code>
C functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a stack imbalance bug that showed up when an assignment was
made to an array of three or more dimensions using a zero-length
subscript.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with <code>news()</code> that was due to pqR's version
numbers being dates (pqR issue #1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed out-of-bound memory accesses in <code>R_chull</code> and <code>scanFrame</code>
that valgrind reports (but which are likely to be innocuous).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The string &quot;infinity&quot; now converts correctly to <code>Inf</code>
(PR#14933).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The generic for backsolve is now correct (PR#14883).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: A bug in <code>get_all_vars</code> was fixed (PR#14847).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: Fixed an argument error checking bug in <code>dev.set</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.0-patched: Fixed a problem with <code>mcmapply</code> not 
parallelizing when the number of jobs was less than number of cores.
(However, unlike R-3.1.0-patched, this fix doesn't try to 
parallelize when there is only one core.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-02-23</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, changes for
compatibility with packages, additional correctness tests, and 
documentation improvements.  There are no new features in this 
release, and no significant changes in performance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the sections below on earlier releases for general
information on pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The information in the file &quot;INSTALL&quot; in the main source directory 
has been re-written.  It now contains all the information expected
to be needed for most installations, without the user needing to
refer to R-admin, including information on the configuration
options that have been added for pqR.  It also has information on
how to build pqR from a development version downloaded from github.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Additional tests regarding subsetting operations, maintenance of
NAMEDCNT, and operation of helper threads have been written.
They are run with <code>make check</code> or <code>make check-all</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A &quot;create-configure&quot; shell script is now included, which allows
for creation of the &quot;configure&quot; shell script when it is non-functional
or not present (as when building from a development version of pqR).
It is not needed for typical installs of pqR releases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some problems with installation on Microsoft Windows (identified
by Yu Gong) have hopefully been fixed.  (But trying to install
pqR on Windows is still recommended only for adventurous users.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A problem with installing pqR as a shared library when multithreading
is disabled has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus 
C or Fortran routines called by <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>) that
were compiled and installed under R Core versions of R must be 
re-installed for use with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions
of R (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 or pqR-2013-12-29 with this 
release, because the formats of the crucial internal data structures 
happen not to have changed).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The instructions in &quot;INSTALL&quot; have been re-written, as noted above.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The manual on &quot;Writing R Extensions&quot; now has additional information 
(in the section on &quot;Named objects and copying&quot;) on paying proper attention
to NAMED for objects found in lists.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> More instructions on how to create a release branch of pqR from a 
development branch have been added to mods/README (or MODS).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>CHANGES REGARDING PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY AND CHECKING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Changed the behaviour of <code>$</code> when dispatching so that the unevaluated
element name arrives as a string, as in R-2.15.0.  This behaviour is
needed for the &quot;dyn&quot; package.  The issue is illustrated by the
following code:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- list(p=3,q=4)
    class(a) &lt;- "fred"
    `$.fred` &lt;-
      function (x,n) { print(list(n,substitute(n))); x[[n]] }
    print(a$q)
</PRE>
In R-2.15.0, both elements of the list printed are strings, but in
pqR-2013-12-29, the element from &quot;substitute&quot; is a symbol.  Changed
<code>help("$")</code> to document this behaviour, and the corresponding 
behaviour of <code>"$&lt;-"</code>.  Added a test with <code>make check</code> for it.
</li>
<li><p> Redefined &quot;fork&quot; to &quot;Rf_fork&quot; so that helper threads can be disabled
in the child when &quot;fork&quot; is used in packages like &quot;multicore&quot;. 
(Special mods for this had previously been made to the &quot;parallel&quot; 
package, but this is a more universal scheme.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added an option (currently set) for pqR to ignore incorrect zero
pointers encountered by the garbage collector (as R-2.15.0 does).
This avoids crashes with some packages (eg, &quot;birch&quot;) that incorrectly
set up objects with zero pointers.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed a C procedure name in the &quot;matprod&quot; routines to reduce the
chance of a name conflict with C code in packages.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Made <code>NA_LOGICAL</code> and <code>NA_INTEGER</code> appear as variables
(rather than constants) in packages, as needed for package
&quot;RcppEigen&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Made <code>R_CStackStart</code> and <code>R_CStackLimit</code> visible to 
packages, as needed for package &quot;vimcom&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed problem with using <code>NAMED</code> in a package that defines
<code>USE_RINTERNALS</code>, such as &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Calls of external routines with .Call and .External are now
followed by checks that the routine didn't incorrectly change 
the constant objects sometimes used internally in pqR for TRUE, 
FALSE, and NA.  (Previously, such checks were made only after calls 
of .C and .Fortran.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
</p>
<PRE>    x &lt;- t(5)
    print (x %*% c(3,4))
    print (crossprod(5,c(3,4)))
</PRE>
The call of <code>crossprod</code> produced an error, whereas the corresponding
use of <code>%*%</code> does not.
In pqR-2013-12-29, this bug also affected the expression 
<code>t(5) %*% c(3,4)</code>, since it is converted to the equivalent of 
<code>crossprod(5,c(3,4))</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem in R_AllocStringBuffer that could result in
a crash due to an invalid memory access.  (This bug is also
present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in a &quot;matprod&quot; routine sometimes affecting 
<code>tcrossprod</code> (or an equivalent use of <code>%*%</code>) with 
helper threads.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    f &lt;- function (a)
    { x &lt;- a
      function () { b &lt;- a; b[2]&lt;-1000; a+b  }
    }
    g &lt;- f(c(7,8,9))
    save.image("tmpimage")
    load("tmpimage")
    print(g())
</PRE>
where the result printed was 14 2000 18 rather than 14 1008 18.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>prod</code> with an integer vector containing <code>NA</code>, 
such as, <code>prod(NA)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack-of-protection bug in mkCharLenCE that showed up
in checks for packages &quot;cmrutils&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with xtfrm demonstrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    f&lt;-function(...) xtfrm(...); f(c(1,3,2))
</PRE>
which produced an error saying '...' was used in an incorrect context.
This affected package &quot;lsr&quot;. 
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in maintaining NAMEDCNT when assigning to a variable in
an environment using <code>$</code>, which showed up in package &quot;plus&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that causes the code below to create a circular data 
structure:
</p>
<PRE>    { a &lt;- list(1); a[[1]] &lt;- a; a }
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs such as that illustrated below:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- list(list(list(1)))
    b &lt;- a
    a[[1]][[1]][[1]]&lt;-2
    print(b)
</PRE>
in which the assignment to <code>a</code> changes <code>b</code>, and added tests
for such bugs.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where unary minus might improperly reuse its operand for
the result even when it was logical (eg, in <code>-c(F,T,T,F)</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in pairlist element deletion, and added tests in subset.R
for such cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The ISNAN trick (if enabled) is now used only in the interpreter itself,
not in packages, since the macro implementing it evaluates its argument
twice, which doesn't work if it has side effects (as happens in the 
&quot;ff&quot; package).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in task merging being disabled
when it shouldn't have been.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-12-29</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is the first publicized release of pqR after pqR-2013-07-22.  
A verson dated 2013-11-28 was released for testing; it differs
from this release only in bug and documentation fixes, which
are not separately detailed in this NEWS file.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by
implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See the notes
below on earlier pqR releases for general discussion of pqR, and for
information that has not changed from previous releases of pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The most notable change in this release is that &ldquo;task merging&rdquo;
is now implemented.  This can speed up sequences
of vector operations by merging several operations into one, which 
reduces time spent writing and later reading data in memory. 
See <code>help(merging)</code> and the item below for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release also includes other performance improvements, bug fixes,
and code cleanups, as detailed below.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Additional configuration options are now present to allow
enabling and disabling of task merging, and more generally, of the
deferred evaluation framework needed for both task merging and
use of helper threads.  By default, these facilities are enabled.
The <code>--disable-task-merging</code> option to <code>./configure</code>
disables task merging, <code>--disable-helper-threads</code> disables
support for helper threads (as before), and 
<code>--disable-deferred-evaluation</code> disables both of these
features, along with the whole deferred evaluation framework.
See the <code>R-admin</code> manual for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the pqR wiki at <code>https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki</code>
for the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
work with pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus 
C or Fortran routines called by <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>) that
were compiled and installed under R Core versions of R must be 
re-installed for use with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions
of R (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 with this release, because the 
formats of the crucial internal data structures happen not to have
changed).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Additional tests of matrix multiplication (<code>%*%</code>, <code>crossprod</code>,
and <code>tcrossprod</code>) have been written.  They are run with
<code>make check</code> or <code>make check-all</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The table of built-in function names, C functions implementing them, and
operation flags, which was previously found in <code>src/main/names.c</code>,
has been split into multiple tables, located in the source files that 
define such built-in functions (with only a few entries still in 
<code>names.c</code>).  This puts the descriptions of these built-in
functions next to their definitions, improving maintainability, and
also reduces the number of global functions.  This change should have 
no effects visible to users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The initialization for fast dispatch to some primitive functions
is now done in <code>names.c</code>, using tables in other source files
analogous to those described in the point just above.  This is 
cleaner, and eliminates an anomaly in the previous versions of
pqR that a primitive function could be slower the first time it was
used than when used later.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Some sequences of vector operations can now be merged into a single
operation, which can speed them up by eliminating memory operations
to store and fetch intermediate results.  For example, when <code>v</code> is 
a long vector, the expression 
<code>exp(v+1)</code> can be merged into one task, which will compute 
<code>exp(v[i]+1)</code> for each element, <code>i</code>, of <code>v</code> in a 
single loop.  
</p>
<p>Currently, such &ldquo;task merging&rdquo; is done only for (some)
operations in which only one operand is a vector. When there are
helper threads (which might be able to do some operations even
faster, in parallel) merging is done only when one of the
operations merged is a simple addition, subtraction, or
multiplication (with one vector operand and one scalar operand).
</p>
<p>See <code>help(merging)</code> for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> During all garbage collections, any tasks whose outputs are not
referenced are now waited for, to allow memory used by their outputs to be
recovered.  (Such unreferenced outputs should be rare in real 
programs.)  In a full garbage collection, tasks with large inputs
or outputs that are referenced only as task inputs
are also waited for, so that the memory they occupy can be recovered.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The built-in C matrix multiplication routines and those in the supplied 
BLAS have both been sped up, especially those used by <code>crossprod</code>
and <code>tcrossprod</code>.  This will of course have no effect if a different
BLAS is used and the <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option is set to
<code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Matrix multiplications in which one operand can be recognized as the
result of a transpose operation are now done without actually creating
the transpose as an intermediate result, thereby reducing both 
computation time and memory usage.  Effectively, these uses of the
<code>%*%</code> operator are converted to uses of <code>crossprod</code> or
<code>tcrossprod</code>.  See <code>help("%*%")</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Speed of <code>ifelse</code> has been improved (though it's now slower when the
condition is scalar due to the bug fix mentioned below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Inputs to the mod operator can now be piped. (Previously, this was 
inadvertently prevented in some cases.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of the quick check for NA/NaN that can be enabled with 
<code>-DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK</code> in CFLAGS has been improved.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>ifelse</code> with scalar condition but other
operands with length greater than one.  (Pointed out by Luke Tierney.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug stemming from re-use of operand storage for a result
(pointed out by Luke Tierney) illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   A &lt;- array(c(1), dim = c(1,1), dimnames = list("a", 1))
   x &lt;- c(a=1)
   A/(pi*x)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers</code> configuration
setting is now respected for complex matrix multiplication
(previously it had only disabled use of the BLAS in helper
threads for real matrix multiplication).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation for <code>aperm</code> now says that the default
method does not copy attributes (other than dimensions and
dimnames).  Previously, it incorrecty said it did (as is the
case also in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed <code>apply</code> from previous versions of pqR to replicate
the behaviour seen in R-2.15.0 (and later R Core version) when the matrix 
or array has a class attribute.  Documented this behaviour (which is
somewhat dubious and convoluted) in the help entry for <code>apply</code>.
This change fixes a problem seen in package TSA (and probably others).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed <code>rank</code> from prevous versions of pqR to replicate
the behaviour when it is applied to data frames that is seen in R-2.15.0 
(and later R Core versions).  Documented this (somewhat dubious) 
behaviour in the help entry for <code>rank</code>.  This change fixes a
problem in the <code>coin</code> package.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in keeping track of references when assigning 
repeated elements into a list array.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
</p>
<PRE>   v &lt;- c(1,2)
   m &lt;- matrix(c(3,4),1,2)
   print(t(m)%*%v)
   print(crossprod(m,v))
</PRE>
in which <code>crossprod</code> gave an error rather than produce the answer
for the corresponding use of <code>%*%</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Bypassed a problem with the Xcode gcc compiler for the Mac that 
led to it falsely saying that using -DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in CFLAGS
doesn't work.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-07-22</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by
implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See the notes
below, on the release of 2013-06-28, for general discussion of pqR,
and for information on pqR that has not changed since that release.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This updated release of pqR provides some performance
enhancements and bug fixes, including some from R Core releases after
R-2.15.0.  More work is still needed to incorporate improvements in
R-2.15.1 and later R Core releases into pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release is the same as the briefly-released version of
2013-17-19, except that it fixes one bug and one reversion of an
optimization that were introduced in that release, and tweaks the
Windows Makefiles (which are not yet fully tested).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE AND DOCUMENTATION CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Detailed information on what operations can be done in helper
threads is now provided by help(helpers).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignment to parts of a vector via code such as 
<code>v[[i]]&lt;-value</code> and <code>v[ix]&lt;-values</code> now automatically 
converts raw values to the appropriate type
for assignment into numeric or string vectors, and assignment
of numeric or string values into a raw vector now results in the
raw vector being first converted to the corresponding type.  This
is consistent with the existing behaviour with other types.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The allowed values for assignment to an element of an &quot;expression&quot; 
list has been expanded to match the allowed values for ordinary
lists.  These values (such as function closures) could previously 
occur in expression lists as a result of other operations (such
as creation with the <code>expression</code> primitive).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Operations such as
<code>v &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3); v[[-2]] &lt;- NULL</code> now raise an error.
These operations were previously documented as being illegal, and
they are illegal for ordinary lists.  The proper way to do
this deletion is <code>v &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3); v[-2] &lt;- NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Raising <code>-Inf</code> to a large value (eg, <code>(-Inf)^(1e16)</code>)
no longer produces an incomprehensible warning.  As before, the 
value returned is <code>Inf</code>, because (due to their 
limited-precision floating-point representation) all such large 
numbers are even integers.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: On Windows, there are two new environment variables which
control the defaults for command-line options.
</p>
<p>If <span class="env">R_WIN_INTERNET2</span> is set to a non-empty value, it is as if
<span class="option">--internet2</span> was used.
</p>
<p>If <span class="env">R_MAX_MEM_SIZE</span> is set, it gives the default memory limit
if <span class="option">--max-mem-size</span> is not specified: invalid values being
ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The NA warning messages from e.g. <code>pchisq()</code> now 
report the call to the closure and not that of the <code>.Internal</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The following included software has been updated to new versions:
zlib to 1.2.8, LZMA to 5.0.4, and PCRE to 8.33.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> See the pqR wiki at <code>https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki</code>
for the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
work with pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any previosly-installed packages must be re-installed for 
use with pqR (as is generally the case with new versions of R), except
for those written purely in R.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is now known that pqR can be successfully installed under Mac
OS X for use via the command line (at least with some versions
of OS X).  The gcc 4.2
compiler supplied by Apple with Xcode works when helper threads
are disabled, but does not have the full OpenMP support required for
helper threads.   For helper threads to work, a C compiler that fully
supports OpenMP is needed, such as gcc 4.7.3 (available via 
macports.org).
</p>
<p>The Apple BLAS and LAPACK routines can be used by giving the
<code>--with-blas='-framework vecLib'</code> and <code>--withlapack</code>
options to <code>configure</code>.  This speeds up some operations
but slows down others.
</p>
<p>The R Mac GUI would need to be recompiled for use with pqR.
There are problems doing this unless helper threads
are disabled (see pqR issue #17 for discussion).
</p>
<p>Compiled binary versions of pqR for Mac OS X are not yet being supplied.
Installation on a Mac is recommended only for users experienced
in installation of R from source code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Success has also been reported in installing pqR on a Windows
system, including with helper threads, but various tweaks were
required.  Some of these tweaks are incorporated in this release,
but they are probably not sufficient for installation &quot;out of the box&quot;.
Attempting to install pqR on Windows is recommended only for
users who are both experienced and adventurous.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Compilation using the <code>-O3</code> option for gcc is not recommended.
It speeds up some operations, but slows down others.  With gcc 4.7.3
on a 32-bit Intel system running Ubuntu 13.04, compiling with 
<code>-O3</code> causes compiled functions to crash. (This is not a
pqR issue, since the same thing happens when R-2.15.0 is compiled 
with <code>-O3</code>).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The R internals manual now documents (in Section 1.8) a
preliminary set of conventions that pqR follows (not yet
perfectly) regarding when objects may be modified, and how
NAMEDCNT should be maintained.  R-2.15.0 did not follow any
clear conventions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation in the R internals manual on how helper
threads are implemented in pqR now has the correct title.  (It
would previously have been rather hard to notice.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Some unnecessary duplication of objects has been eliminated.  Here
are three examples:  
Creation of lists no longer duplicates all the elements put in the
list, but instead increments <code>NAMEDCNT</code> for these elements, so
that
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- numeric(10000)
   k &lt;- list(1,a)
</PRE>
no longer duplicates <code>a</code> when <code>k</code> is created (though a duplication
will be needed later if either <code>a</code> or <code>k[[2]]</code> is modified).
Furthermore, the assignment below to <code>b$x</code>, no longer
causes duplication of the 10000 elements of <code>y</code>:
<PRE>   a &lt;- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
   b &lt;- a
   b$x &lt;- 2
</PRE>
Instead, a single vector of 10000 elements is shared between <code>a$y</code> and
<code>b$y</code>, and will be duplicated later only if necessary.  Unnecessary
duplication of a 10000-element vector is also avoided when <code>b[1]</code> is 
assigned to in the code below:
<PRE>   a &lt;- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
   b &lt;- a$y
   a$y &lt;- 0
   b[1] &lt;- 1
</PRE>
The assignment to <code>a$y</code> now reduces <code>NAMEDCNT</code> for the vector
bound to <code>b</code>, allowing it to be changed without duplication.
</li>
<li><p> Assignment to part of a vector using code such as <code>v[101:200]&lt;-0</code>
will now not actually create a vector of 100 indexes, but will instead
simply change the elements with indexes 101 to 200 without creating
an index vector.  This optimization has not yet been implemented for
matrix or array indexing.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments to parts of vectors, matrices, and arrays using &quot;[&quot; has been
sped up by detailed code improvements, quite substantially in some
cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Subsetting of arrays of three or more dimensions using &quot;[&quot; has
been sped up by detailed code improvements.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Pending summations of one-argument mathematical functions are now
passed on by <code>sum</code>.  So, for example, in 
<code>sum(exp(a)) + sum(exp(b))</code>, the two
summations of exponentials can now potentially be done in parallel.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A full garbage collection now does not wait for all tasks being
done by helpers to complete.  Instead, only tasks that are using
or computing variables that are not otherwise referenced are 
waited for (so that this storage can be reclaimed).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A bug that could have affected the result of <code>sum(abs(v))</code> when
it is done by a helper thread has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A bug that could have allowed <code>as.vector</code>, <code>as.integer</code>, etc.
to pass on an object still being computed to a caller not expecting
such a pending object has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some bugs in which production of warnings at inopportune times could 
have caused serious problems have been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The bug illustrated below (pqR issue #13) has been fixed:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; l = list(list(list(1)))
   &gt; l1 = l[[1]]
   &gt; l[[c(1,1,1)]] &lt;- 2
   &gt; l1
   [[1]]
   [[1]][[1]]
   [1] 2
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) illustrated by the
following code:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; a &lt;- list(x=c(1,2),y=c(3,4))
   &gt; b &lt;- as.pairlist(a)
   &gt; b$x[1] &lt;- 9
   &gt; print(a)
   $x
   [1] 9 2
   
   $y
   [1] 3 4
</PRE>
The value printed for a has a$x[1] changed to 9, when it should still be 1.
See pqR issue #14.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) in which extending
an &quot;expression&quot; by assigning to a new element changes it to an ordinary
list.  See pqR issue #15.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed several bugs (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) illustrated
by the code below (see pqR issue #16):
</p>
<PRE>   v &lt;- c(10,20,30)
   v[[2]] &lt;- NULL        # wrong error message
   
   x &lt;- pairlist(list(1,2))
   x[[c(1,2)]] &lt;- NULL   # wrongly gives an error, referring to misuse
                         # of the internal SET_VECTOR_ELT procedure
   
   v&lt;-list(1)
   v[[quote(abc)]] &lt;- 2  # internal error, this time for SET_STRING_ELT
   
   a &lt;- pairlist(10,20,30,40,50,60)
   dim(a) &lt;- c(2,3)
   dimnames(a) &lt;- list(c("a","b"),c("x","y","z"))
   print(a)              # doesn't print names
   
   a[["a","x"]] &lt;- 0     # crashes with a segmentation fault
</PRE>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>formatC()</code> uses the C entry point <code>str_signif</code>
which could write beyond the length allocated for the output string.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE)</code> no longer
underflows early for large x (e.g. 800).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>?Arithmetic</code>'s &ldquo;<code>1 ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ 0</code>
are <code>1</code>, <EM>always</EM>&rdquo; now also applies for <code>integer</code>
vectors <code>y</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: X11-based pixmap devices like <code>png(type = "Xlib")</code> 
were trying to set the cursor style, which triggered some warnings and
hangs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1 patched: Fixed comment-out bug in BLAS, as per PR 14964.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-06-28</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release of pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R
Core Team, but improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it
up, but also by implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.
One notable speed improvement in pqR is that for systems with multiple
processors or processor cores, pqR is able to do some numeric
computations in parallel with other operations of the interpreter, and
with other numeric computations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This is the second publicised release of pqR (the first was on
2013-06-20, and there were earlier unpublicised releases). It fixes one
significant pqR bug (that could cause two empty strings to not compare
as equal, reported by Jon Clayden), fixes a bug reported to R Core (PR
15363) that also existed in pqR (see below), fixes a bug in deciding
when matrix multiplies are best done in a helper thread, and fixes some
issues preventing pqR from being built in some situations (including
some partial fixes for Windows suggested by &quot;armgong&quot;).  Since the
rest of the news is almost unchanged from the previous release, I have
not made a separate news section for this release. (New sections will
be created once new releases have significant differences.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This section documents changes in pqR from R-2.15.0 that are of
direct interest to users.  For changes from earlier version of R to
R-2.15.0, see the ONEWS, OONEWS, and OOONEWS files.  Changes of little
interest to users, such as code cleanups and internal details on
performance improvements, are documented in the file MODS, which
relates these changes to branches in the code repository at
github.com/radfordneal/pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that for compatibility with R's version system, pqR presently
uses the same version number, 2.15.0, as the version of R on which it
is based. This allows checks for feature availability to continue to
work.  This scheme will likely change in the future.  Releases of pqR
with the same version number are distinguished by release date.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See radfordneal.github.io/pqR for current information on pqR, including
announcements of new releases, a link to the page for making and viewing
reports of bugs and other issues, and a link to the wiki page containing
information such as systems on which pqR has been tested.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A new primitive function <code>get_rm</code> has been added,
which removes a variable while returning the value it
had when removed.  See <code>help(get_rm)</code> for details,
and how this can sometimes improve efficiency of R functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> An enhanced version of the <code>Rprofmem</code> function for profiling
allocation of vectors has been implemented, that can
display more information, and can output to the terminal,
allowing the source of allocations to more easily be
determined.  Also, <code>Rprofmem</code> is now always accessible
(not requiring the <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code> configuration
option).  Its overhead when not in use is negligible.
</p>
<p>The new version allows records of memory allocation to be
output to the terminal, where their position relative to
other output can be informative (this is the default for the
new <code>Rprofmemt</code> variant).  More identifying
information, including type, number of elements, and
hexadecimal address, can also be output.  For more details on
these and other changes, see <code>help(Rprofmem)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A new primitive function, pnamedcnt, has been added, that
prints the NAMEDCNT/NAMED count for an R object, which is helpful
in tracking when objects will have to be duplicated.  For
details, see help(pnamedcnt).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>tracemem</code> function is defunct.  What exactly it was
supposed to do in R-2.15.0 was unclear, and optimizations 
in pqR make it even less clear what it should do.  The bit
in object headers that was used to implement it has been
put to a better use in pqR.  The <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code>
configuration option used to enable it no longer exists.
</p>
<p>The <code>retracemem</code> function remains for compatibility
(doing nothing).  The <code>Rprofmemt</code> and <code>pnamedcnt</code>
functions described above provide alternative ways of gaining
insight into memory allocation behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some options that can be set by arguments to the R command can
now also be set with environment variables, specifically, the
values of R_DEBUGGER, R_DEBUGGER_ARGS, and R_HELPERS give the
default when <code>--debugger</code>, <code>--debugger-args</code>, and 
<code>--helpers</code> are not specified on the command line.  This 
feature is useful when using a shell file or Makefile that contains 
R commands that one would rather not have to modify.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The procedure for compiling and installing from source is largely 
unchanged from R-2.15.0.  In particular, the final result is a 
program called &quot;R&quot;, not &quot;pqR&quot;, though of course you can provide a 
link to it called &quot;pqR&quot;.  Note that (as for R-2.15.0) it is not 
necessary to do an &quot;install&quot; after &quot;make&quot; &mdash; one can just
run bin/R in the directory where you did &quot;make&quot;.  This may be 
convenient if you wish to try out pqR along with your current 
version of R.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Testing of pqR has so far been done only on Linux/Unix
systems, not on Windows or Mac systems.  There is no specific
reason to believe that it will not work on Windows or Mac
systems, but until tests have been done, trying to use it 
on these systems is not recommended.  (However, some users
have reported that pqR can be built on Mac systems, as long
as a C compiler fully supporting OpenMP is used, or the
<code>--disable-helper-threads</code> configuration option is used.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release contains the versions of the standard and recommended
packages that were released with R-2.15.0.  Newer versions may
or may not be compatible (same as for R-2.15.0).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is intended that this release will be fully compatible with
R-2.15.0, but you will need to recompile any packages (other
that those with only R code) that you had installed for R-2.15.0, 
and any other C code you use with R, since the format of internal 
data structures has changed (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> New configuration options relating to helper threads and
to matrix multiplication now exist.  For details, see 
doc/R-admin.html (or R-admin.pdf), or run <code>./configure --help</code>.
</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>--disable-helper-threads</code> option
to configure will remove support for helper threads.  Use of
this option is advised if you know that multiple processors
or processor cores will not be available, or if you know that
the C compiler used does not support OpenMP 3.0 or 3.1 (which 
is used in the implementation of the helpers package).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Including <code>-DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK</code> in CFLAGS will speed up 
checks for NA and NaN on machines on which it works.  It works
on Intel processors (verified both empirically and by consulting
Intel documentation).  It does not work on SPARC machines.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code> option to configure
no longer exists.  In pqR, the <code>Rprofmem</code> function is always
enabled, and the <code>tracemem</code> function is defunct.  (See
discussion above.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When installing from source, the output of configure 
now displays whether standard and recommended packages will
be byte compiled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The tests of random number generation run with <code>make check-all</code>
now set the random number seed explicitly.  Previously, the random
number seed was set from the time and process ID, with the result
that these tests would occasionally fail non-deterministically,
when by chance one of the p-values obtained was below the threshold
used.  (Any such failure should now occur consistently, rather
than appearing to be due to a non-deterministic bug.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that (as in R-2.15.0) the output of <code>make check-all</code> for 
the boot package includes many warning messages regarding a 
non-integer argument, and when byte compilation is enabled, these 
messages identify the wrong function call as the source.  This 
appears to have no wider implications, and can be ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Testing of the &quot;xz&quot; compression method is now done with <code>try</code>,
so that failure will be tolerated on machines that don't have enough
memory for these tests.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The details of how valgrind is used have changed. See the source
file &lsquo;<span class="file">memory.c</span>&rsquo;.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The internal structure of an object has changed, in ways that 
should be compatible with R-2.15.0, but which do require 
re-compilation.  The flags in the object header for <code>DEBUG</code>,
<code>RSTEP</code>, and <code>TRACE</code> now exist only for non-vector 
objects, which is sufficient for their present use (now that 
<code>tracemem</code> is defunct).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The sizes of objects have changed in some cases (though not most).
For a 32-bit configuration, the size of a cons cell increases
from 28 bytes to 32 bytes; for a 64-bit configuration, the
size of a cons cell remains at 56 bytes.  For a 32-bit 
configuration, the size of a vector of one double remains
at 32 bytes; for a 64-bit configuration (with 8-byte alignment), 
the size of a vector of one double remains at 48 bytes.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that the actual amount of memory occupied by an object
depends on the set of node classes defined (which may be tuned).
There is no longer a separate node class for cons cells and
zero-length vectors (as in R-2.15.0) &mdash; instead, cons cells
share a node class with whatever vectors also fit in that
node class.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The old two-bit NAMED field of an object is now a three-bit
NAMEDCNT field, to allow for a better attempt at reference
counting.  Versions of the the NAMED and SET_NAMED macros
are still defined for compatibility.  See the R-ints manual
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the length of a vector to something less than its
allocated length using SETLENGTH is deprecated.  The LENGTH
field is used for memory allocation tracking by the garbage
collector (as is also the case in R-2.15.0), so setting it 
to the wrong value may cause problems.  (Setting the length
to more than the allocated length is of course even worse.)
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Many detailed improvements have been made that reduce
general interpretive overhead and speed up particular 
functions.  Only some of these improvements are noted
below.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Numerical computations can now be performed in parallel with
each other and with interpretation of R code, by using 
&ldquo;helper threads&rdquo;, on machines
with multiple processors or multiple processor cores.  When
the output of one such computation is used as the input to
another computation, these computations can often be done
in parallel, with the output of one task being &ldquo;pipelined&rdquo;
to the other task.  Note that these 
parallel execution facilities do not require any changes to user 
code &mdash; only that helper threads be enabled with the 
<code>--helpers</code> option to the command starting pqR. See 
<code>help(helpers)</code> for details.
</p>
<p>However, helper threads are not used for operations that are 
done within the interpreter for byte-compiled code or that are 
done in primitive functions invoked by the byte-code interpreter.
</p>
<p>This facility is still undergoing rapid development.  Additional 
documentation on which operations may be done in parallel will be 
forthcoming.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A better attempt at counting how many &quot;names&quot; an object has
is now made, which reduces how often objects are duplicated
unnecessarily.  This change is ongoing, with further improvements
and documentation forthcoming.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Several primitive functions that can generate integer sequences
&mdash; &quot;:&quot;, seq.int, seq_len, and seq_along &mdash; will now sometimes
not generate an actual sequence, but rather just a description
of its start and end points.  This is not visible to users,
but is used to speed up several operations.
</p>
<p>In particular, &quot;for&quot; loops such as <code>for (i in 1:1000000) ...</code>
are now done without actually allocating a vector to hold
the sequence.  This saves both space and time.  Also,
a subscript such as <code>101:200</code> for a vector or as the first 
subscript for a matrix is now (often) handled without actually 
creating a vector of indexes, saving both time and space.  
</p>
<p>However, the above performance improvements 
are not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Matrix multiplications with the <code>%*%</code> operator are now
much faster when the operation is a vector dot product, a
vector-matrix product, a matrix-vector product, or more generally
when the sum of the numbers of rows and columns in the result
is not much less than their product.  This improvement results
from the elimination of a costly check for NA/NaN elements in the 
operands before doing the multiply.  There is no need for this check
if the supplied BLAS is used.  If a BLAS that does not properly
handle NaN is supplied, the <code>%*%</code> operator will still
handle NaN properly if the new library of matrix multiply
routines is used for <code>%*%</code> instead of the BLAS.  See the
next two items for more relevant details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A new library of matrix multiply routines is provided, which
is guaranteed to handle NA/NaN correctly, and which supports
pipelined computation with helper threads.  Whether this
library or the BLAS routines are used for <code>%*%</code> is
controlled by the <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option. The default
is to not use the BLAS, but the 
<code>--enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-by-default</code> configuration option
will change this.  See <code>help("%*%")</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The BLAS routines supplied with R were modified to improve the 
performance of the routines DGEMM (matrix-matrix multiply) and 
DGEMV (matrix-vector multiply).  Also, proper propagation of NaN, 
Inf, etc. is now always done in these routines.  This speeds
up the <code>%*%</code> operator in R, when the supplied BLAS is used
for matrix multiplications, and speeds up other matrix operations
that call these BLAS routines, if the BLAS used is the one supplied.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The low-level routines for generation of uniform random
numbers have been improved.  (These routines are also used for
higher-level functions such as <code>rnorm</code>.)
</p>
<p>The previous code copied the seed back and forth to
.Random.seed for every call of a random number generation
function, which is rather time consuming given that for
the default generator <code>.Random.seed</code> is 625 integers long.
It also allocated new space for <code>.Random.seed</code> every time.
Now, <code>.Random.seed</code> is used without copying, except when the 
generator is user-supplied.  
</p>
<p>The previous code had imposed an unnecessary limit on the
length of a seed for a user-supplied random number
generator, which has now been removed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> primitives have been substantially
sped up for large vectors.  
</p>
<p>Also, expressions such as
<code>all(v&gt;0)</code> and <code>any(is.na(v))</code>, where <code>v</code> is a
real vector, avoid computing and storing a logical vector,
instead computing the result of <code>any</code> or <code>all</code>
without this intermediate, looking at only as much of <code>v</code>
as is needed to determine the result.
However, this improvement is not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When <code>sum</code> is applied to many mathematical functions
of one vector argument, for example <code>sum(log(v))</code>, the
sum is performed as the function is computed, without a
vector being allocated to hold the function values.  
However, this improvement is not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The handling of power operations has been improved (primarily 
for powers of reals, but slightly affecting powers of integers too).
In particular, scalar powers of 2, 1, 0, and -1, are handled 
specially to avoid general power operations in these cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Extending lists and character vectors by assigning to an
index past the end, and deleting list items by assigning NULL
have been sped up substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of the transpose (<code>t</code>) function has been
improved, when applied to real, integer, and logical
matrices.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>cbind</code> and <code>rbind</code> functions have been greatly
sped up for large objects.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>c</code> and <code>unlist</code> functions have been sped up 
by a bit in simple cases, and by a lot in some situations 
involving names.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>matrix</code> function has been greatly sped up, in
many cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Extraction of subsets of vectors or matrices (eg, <code>v[100:200]</code>
or <code>M[1:100,101:110]</code>) has been sped up substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Logical operations and relational operators have been sped up
in simple cases. Relational
operators have also been substantially sped up for long vectors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Access via the $ operator to lists, pairlists, and environments 
has been sped up. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Existing code for handling special cases of &quot;[&quot; in which there is
only one scalar index was replaced by cleaner code that handles 
more cases.   The old code handled only integer and real vectors, 
and only positive indexes.  The new code handles all atomic 
vectors (logical, integer, real, complex, raw, and string), and 
positive or negative indexes that are not out of bounds.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many unary and binary primitive functions are now usually
called using a faster internal interface that does not allocate
nodes for a pairlist of evaluated arguments. This change
substantially speeds up some programs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Lookup of some builtin/special function symbols (eg, &quot;+&quot; and &quot;if&quot;)
has been sped up by allowing fast bypass of non-global environments
that do not contain (and have never contained) one of these 
symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some binary and unary arithmetic operations have been sped
up by, when possible, using the space holding one of the
operands to hold the result, rather than allocating new
space.  Though primarily a speed improvement, for very
long vectors avoiding this allocation could avoid running
out of space.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some speedup has been obtained by using new internal C functions 
for performing exact or partial string matches in the interpreter.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The &quot;debug&quot; facility has been fixed.  Its behaviour for if,
while, repeat, and for statements when the inner statement
was or was not one with curly brackets had made no sense.
The fixed behaviour is now documented in help(debug). 
(I reported this bug and how
to fix it to the R Core Team in July 2012, but the bug is 
still present in R-3.0.1, released May 2013.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>sum</code>, where overflow is allowed (and not 
detected) where overflow can actually be avoided.  For example:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; v&lt;-c(3L,1000000000L:1010000000L,-(1000000000L:1010000000L))
   &gt; sum(v)
   [1] 4629
</PRE>
Also fixed a related bug in <code>mean</code>, applied to an integer
vector, which would arise only on a system where a long double 
is no bigger than a double.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed <code>diag</code> so that it returns a matrix when passed
a list of elements to put on the diagonal.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that could lead to mis-identification of the 
direction of stack growth on a non-Windows system, causing
stack overflow to not be detected, and a segmentation fault 
to occur.  (I also reported this bug and how to fix it to the 
R Core Team, who included a fix in R-2.15.2.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where, for example, <code>log(base=4)</code> returned 
the natural log of 4, rather than signalling an error. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation on what <code>MARGIN</code> arguments are allowed for
<code>apply</code> has been clarified, and checks for validity added.
The call 
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; apply(array(1:24,c(2,3,4)),-3,sum)
</PRE>
now produces correct results (the same as when <code>MARGIN</code>
is <code>1:2</code>).
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which <code>Im(matrix(complex(0),3,4))</code> returned
a matrix of zero elements rather than a matrix of NA elements.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where more than six warning messages at startup
would overwrite random memory, causing garbage output 
and perhaps arbitrarily bizarre behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where LC_PAPER was not correctly set at startup.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed gc.time, which was producing grossly incorrect values
for user and system time.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Now check for bad arguments for .rowSums, .colSums, .rowMeans,
and .rowMeans (would previously segfault if n*p too big).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where excess warning messages may be produced
on conversion to RAW.  For instance:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; as.raw(1e40)
   [1] 00
   Warning messages:
   1: NAs introduced by coercion 
   2: out-of-range values treated as 0 in coercion to raw 
</PRE>
Now, only the second warning message is produced.
</li>
<li><p> A bug has been fixed in which rbind would not handle 
non-vector objects such as function closures, whereas
cbind did handle them, and both were documented to do so.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in numeric_deriv in stats/src/nls.c, where it
was not duplicating when it should, as illustrated below:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; x &lt;- 5; y &lt;- 2; f &lt;- function (y) x
   &gt; numericDeriv(f(y),"y")
    [1] 5
    attr(,"gradient")
         [,1]
    [1,]    0
    &gt; x
    [1] 5
    attr(,"gradient")
         [,1]
    [1,]    0
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in vapply illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   X&lt;-list(456)
   f&lt;-function(a)X
   A&lt;-list(1,2)  
   B&lt;-vapply(A,f,list(0))
   print(B)
   X[[1]][1]&lt;-444
   print(B)
</PRE>
After the fix, the values in <code>B</code> are no long changed by the 
assignment to <code>X</code>. Similar bugs in mapply, eapply, and rapply 
have also been fixed.  I reported these bugs to r-devel, and
(different) fixes are in R-3.0.0 and later versions.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a but in rep.int illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-list(1,2)
   b&lt;-rep.int(a,c(2,2))
   b[[1]][1]&lt;-9
   print(a[[1]])
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in mget, illustrated by the following code:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- numeric(1)
   x &lt;- mget("a",as.environment(1))
   print(x)
   a[1] &lt;- 9
   print(x)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs that the R Core Team fixed (differently) for R-2.15.3,
illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(c(1,2),c(3,4))
   b &lt;- list(1,2,3)
   b[2:3] &lt;- a
   b[[2]][2] &lt;- 99
   print(a[[1]][2])

   a &lt;- list(1+1,1+1)
   b &lt;- list(1,1,1,1)
   b[1:4] &lt;- a
   b[[1]][1] &lt;- 1
   print(b[2:4])
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; library(compiler)
   &gt; foo &lt;- function(x,y) UseMethod("foo")
   &gt; foo.numeric &lt;- function(x,y) "numeric"
   &gt; foo.default &lt;- function(x,y) "default"
   &gt; testi &lt;- function () foo(x=NULL,2)
   &gt; testc &lt;- cmpfun (function () foo(x=NULL,2))
   &gt; testi() 
   [1] "default"
   &gt; testc()
   [1] "numeric"
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed several bugs that produced wrong results 
such as the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-list(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6))
   b&lt;-a[2:3]
   a[[2]][2]&lt;-9
   print(b[[1]][2])
</PRE>
I reported this to r-devel, and a (different) fix is in R-3.0.0 and 
later versions.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs reported on r-devel by Justin Talbot, Jan 2013 (also
fixed, differently, in R-2.15.3), illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(1)
   b &lt;- (a[[1]] &lt;- a)
   print(b)
   a &lt;- list(x=1)
   b &lt;- (a$x &lt;- a)
   print(b)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed <code>svd</code> so that it will not return a list with
<code>NULL</code> elements.  This matches the behaviour of <code>La.svd</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed (by a kludge, not a proper fix) a bug in the &quot;tre&quot;
package for regular expression matching (eg, in <code>sub</code>),
which shows up when <code>WCHAR_MAX</code> doesn't fit in an
&quot;int&quot;.  The kludge reduces <code>WCHAR_MAX</code> to fit, but really
the &quot;int&quot; variables ought to be bigger.  (This problem
showed up on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a minor error-reporting bug with
<code>(1:2):integer(0)</code> and similar expressions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a small error-reporting bug with &quot;$&quot;,
illustrated by the following output:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE)
    &gt; pl &lt;- pairlist(abc=1,def=2)
    &gt; pl$ab
    [1] 1
    Warning message:
    In pl$ab : partial match of 'ab' to ''
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed documentation error in R-admin regarding the
<code>--disable-byte-compiled-packages</code> configuration option, 
and changed the DESCRIPTION file for the recommended mgcv 
package to respect this option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug reported to R Core (PR 15363, 2013-006-26) that
also existed in pqR-2013-06-20.  This bug sometimes caused memory
expansion when many complex assignments or removals were done
in the global environment.
</p>
