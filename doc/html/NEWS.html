<h2> pqR News</h2>

<h3>VERSION OF 2020-07-22</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> This release fixes some installation issues, changes the
URL of the default pqR package repository, and fixes a few bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release also has preliminary implementations of automatic 
differentiation, and of recursive arithmetic on lists (which is
especially useful in conjunction with automatic differentiation).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> For suitably-recent versions, the gfortran option
<code>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</code> is automatically 
enabled, to avoid problems with the Fortran/C 
interface.  See the blog post by Tomas Kalibera
at <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/09/25/gfortran-issues-with-lapack-ii">https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/09/25/gfortran-issues-with-lapack-ii</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For suitably-recent versions, the gfortran option
<code>-fallow-argument-mismatch</code> is automatically enabled,
to avoid language compatibility problems with old Fortran code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For suitably-recent versions, the gcc, g++, and gfortran
option <code>-ffp-contract=off</code> is automatically enabled,
to prevent use of instructions such as fused multiply-add
that would make numerical results be non-reproducible
(for different R code that should be equivalent, for different
processors, for different compilers, and for different
compiler optimization settings).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> On startup, a check is made that fused multiply-adds are not 
done, since this would make numerical results non-reproducible.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed handling of <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS=T</code> or 
<code>mat_mult_with_BLAS=F</code> as an option to configure.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed some problems that show up when using gcc-10.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The default package repository for <code>install.packages</code> is now
<a href="http://repos.pqR-project.org">http://repos.pqR-project.org</a> (followed, if not found there, by 
<a href="http://cloud.r-project.org">http://cloud.r-project.org</a>).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A new automatic differentiation facility has been implemented.
The implementation is not yet polished.  There may be bugs.
In some situations, performance is not as good as it is expected to
be in the final version, and is sometimes drastically inefficient.
This version does, however, demonstrate what the final facility
will be like.
</p>
<p>Type <code>help(Gradient)</code> to read documentation on the automatic 
differentiation facilities.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> One can now do arithmetic (+, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%) on lists 
(and lists of lists, etc.), with the result computed recursively
on elements, elements of elements, etc.
For binary operations, the two operands must be lists that match 
exactly in length and names, or one operand must be a scalar.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the base mathematical functions of one argument may
now be applied to lists, with the results computed
recursively. The two-argument functions <code>log</code>,
<code>atan2</code>, <code>round</code>, and <code>signif</code> can also be
applied to lists (as either or both arguments, or as the single
argument if the second defaults).
</p>
<p>Type <code>help(Listops)</code> for more information.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which dimnames for an array of three or more
dimensions subscripted with <code>[]</code> were not converted
to names (as had been intended) when the result had its 
dimensions dropped, and only one dimension had names.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES FROM R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.1.1: For a formula with exactly 32 variables the 32nd variable
was aliased to the intercept in some C-level computations of
terms, so that for example attempting to remove it would remove
the intercept instead (and leave a corrupt internal structure).
(<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15735">PR#15735</a>).
</p>
<p>[ Note: This also fixes problems with formulas
having zero variables, as manifested, for example, in 
</p>
<PRE>    update.formula (~1, ~. - y)
</PRE>
Thanks to Marduk Bolanos for this example (pqR issue #40). ]
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2019-02-19</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> This is a minor maintenance release, primarily for fixing the
installation issue described below.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed an issue in which &quot;make install&quot; on a Linux or Mac system would
not copy some header files needed when installing some packages.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that is illustrated by the following example output,
from a fresh session started with <code>--vanilla</code>:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; setClass ("bert",prototype=integer(1),contains="numeric")
    &gt; a &lt;- new("bert",5)
    &gt; print(c(a,quote(cat("Hi!\n"))))
    [[1]]
    [1] 5
    
    [[2]]
    cat("Hi!\n")
    
    &gt; setClass ("george",prototype=integer(1),contains="numeric")
    &gt; setMethod ("c","george",function(x,y)777)
    [1] "c"
    &gt; print(c(a,quote(cat("Hi!\n"))))
    Hi!
    [1] 5
</PRE>
The first evaluation of <code>c(a,quote(cat("Hi!\n")))</code> correctly
created a list containing the value of <code>a</code> and the quoted language
object.  After a method for <code>c</code> for class <code>"george"</code> was
defined, evaluating the same expression results in the quoted
argument being double-evaluated, so <code>"Hi\n"</code> is printed, and 
the value of <code>a</code> is concatenated with <code>NULL</code>.
This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least 3.5.2.  A
comment in the source code implies that this may be a long-known
bug, which is being tolerated, although the fix is not difficult.
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2019-01-25</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release, with some bug fixes, minor feature
changes, and small performance improvements.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Installation on recent versions of macOS now works when using
recent versions of gcc (not clang, or the &quot;gcc&quot; alias for clang)
when use of Apple's BLAS routines is enabled with the configure option
</p>
<PRE>    --with-blas='-framework Accelerate'
</PRE>
This is done by using the &quot;gcc&quot; clang alias when compiling one
small glue routine (so this must exist).
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> It is now allowed to use <code>...</code> anywhere an expression is
allowed when <code>...</code> refers to exactly one argument.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>D</code> and <code>deriv</code> no longer add parenthesis in (some of)
the places where they would be needed according to precedence, since
this slows evaluation, and is unnecessary considering that
<code>deparse</code> adds such parentheses.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES RESEMBLING, OR NOT, THOSE IN R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.4.0: Arithmetic, logic (<code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>) and comparison (aka
&lsquo;relational&rsquo;, e.g., <code>&lt;</code>, <code>==</code>) operations with
arrays now behave consistently, notably for arrays of length zero.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Contrary to R-3.4.0:  R-3.4.0 declares that &quot;Arithmetic between
length-1 arrays and longer non-arrays had
silently dropped the array attributes and recycled.  This now
gives a warning and will signal an error in the future, as it has
always for logic and comparison operations in these cases (e.g.,
compare <code>matrix(1,1) + 2:3</code> and <code>matrix(1,1) &lt; 2:3</code>).&quot;
</p>
<p>This change was inadvisable, breaking backwards compatibility
while increasing the probability that bugs will go undetected
(since programmers will respond by dropping dimensions with code
such as <code>v+c(a%*%b)</code> when <code>a%*%b</code> is expected to be a
vector dot product, suppressing an error when, because of a bug,
<code>a%*%b</code> turns out not to be a 1-by-1 matrix.)
</p>
<p>In pqR, consistency is instead obtained by now allowing comparisons
and logical operations on vectors and 1-by-1 matrices, as for 
arithmetic operators.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.4.0: The <code>deriv()</code> and similar functions now can compute
derivatives of <code>log1p()</code>, <code>sinpi()</code> and similar
one-argument functions, thanks to a contribution by Jerry Lewis.
[ Except that <code>sinpi</code>, etc. are not yet in pqR. ]
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>is.na</code>, <code>is.nan</code>, <code>is.finite</code>, and 
<code>is.infinite</code> functions are now faster for unnamed 
scalar arguments.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>sample</code> function has been sped up for some cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Common cases of <code>UseMethod</code> have been sped up.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Calls of functions in <code>base</code> from other functions in <code>base</code>
have been sped up.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug involving the &quot;scalar stack&quot; that could affect evaluation 
of arithmetic operations when deep recursion has occurred.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that could lead to the <code>BLAS_in_helpers</code> option
being garbage.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the misleading/ambiguous/incorrect/incomprehensible documentation
on the <code>log</code>, <code>log.p</code>, and <code>lower.tail</code> arguments of
all the density, distribution, and quantile functions for standard
distributions (eg, <code>dgeom</code>, <code>pgeom</code>, <code>qgeom</code>).
This incorrect documentation is also present in R Core versions to
at least R-3.5.2.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Incorrect documentation in <code>help(Arithmetic)</code> has been
corrected.  This previously claimed that &quot;If applied to arrays
the result will be an array if this is sensible (for example
it will not if the recycling rule has been invoked).&quot;  The
parenthesized phrase has been deleted, since it is not true.
This documentation bug is also present in R Core versions to
at least R-3.5.2.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In <code>help(Comparison)</code>, inaccurate information (regarding 
zero-length vectors and lists) and bad advice has been corrected.
These problems are also in R Core documentation to a least 
R-3.5.2.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES FROM R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.4.4: <code>is.na(NULL)</code> no longer warns.  (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=16107">PR#16107</a>)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2018-11-18</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release has many significant performance improvements.
It also has some new or changed features, including some from
later R Core versions, and some bug fixes.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> One notable change is
that when code is read with <code>source</code>, or done with <code>Rscript</code>,
or parsed from text strings or a file, an error is no longer produced
when an <code>else</code> at the top level appears at the beginning
of a line.  See below for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> New binary operators <code>!!</code> and <code>!</code> have been introduced
as more concise ways of writing <code>paste</code> and <code>paste0</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> With the performance improvements in this release, it is
generally no longer desirable to use the bytecode compiler.
Defaults during configuration and use have therefore been
changed so that the bytecode compiler, and byte-compiled code,
will not be used unless very deliberately enabled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Platforms on which pqR is used must now correctly implement
64-bit IEEE floating-point arithmetic.  This is a preliminary to future
changes aimed at improving reproducibility of numerical results.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION, TESTING, AND PACKAGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Byte compilation is now discouraged, because on the whole it 
makes performance worse rather than better, since it does not
support some pqR performance improvements, and also because it does not
implement some pqR language extensions.
</p>
<p>When pqR is configured, <code>--disable-byte-compiled-packages</code>
is now the default.
</p>
<p>It is still possible to enable byte compilation, but this is
meant only for research purposes, to compare performance of
interpreted and byte-compiled code.  No byte compilation
of packages will be done unless the <code>R_PKG_BYTECOMPILE</code>
environment variable is set to <code>TRUE</code>, regardless of any
other settings.  Byte code will not be used when evaluating
expressions unless the <code>R_USE_BYTECODE</code> environment
variable is set to <code>TRUE</code>, even if its evaluation is
explicitly requested.
</p>
<p>The JIT feature is now never enabled, regardless of any attempt
to do so.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> By default, <code>install.packages</code> now looks first in the
pqR repository, at <a href="ftp://price.utstat.utoronto.ca">ftp://price.utstat.utoronto.ca</a>, and
if the package is not found there, at the CRAN mirror located
at <a href="http://cloud.r-project.org">http://cloud.r-project.org</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A platform on which pqR is installed must now
implement correct 64-bit IEEE floating-point arithmetic for the C 
&quot;double&quot; type.  In particular, this means that pqR is not supported
on Intel x86 platforms without SSE2 instructions (Pentium III
and earlier), since given current software environments, it is 
effectively impossible to use the FPU in these system to
perform correctly-rounded 64-bit floating-point operations.
</p>
<p>On processors with fused multiply-add instructions, achieving
reproducible IEEE arithmetic will require compiling with the 
gcc/clang option <code>-ffp-contract=off</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The malloc/free routines written by Doug Lea (in
src/extra/dlmalloc), which by default are used for Windows platforms,
can now also be used for non-Windows platforms, by including
<code>-DLEA_MALLOC</code> in <code>CFLAGS</code>.  This is meant for 
experimentation, and is not recommended for general use.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> More testing of the correctness of matrix multiplication
operations is now done by <code>make check</code>.  Setting the
<code>R_MATPROD_TEST_COUNT</code> environment variable to a value
greater than the default of 200 will increase the number of
random cases of matrix multiplication that are generated and
checked.  Setting <code>R_MATPROD_TEST_BLAS</code> to TRUE will
case the BLAS matrix multiplication routines to be tested
as well as the C matprod functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Recommended packages that have been tweaked to work with pqR
(sometimes just to change the version of R depended on)
are now marked by having a version number ending in -909.
A source code repository recording the changes to these (and
other) packages may be found at 
</p>
<PRE>    https://github.com/radfordneal/R-package-mods
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> The interpreter now aborts if it detects a protection stack
imbalance.  This previously resulted only in a message being
printed, which might be overlooked; this change ensures that
the error will be noticed.  Also, continuing after an imbalance
is detected is not safe, since bad maintenance of the protection
stack can lead to garbage collection of objects that are still
in use, and thence to arbitrary memory corruption.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> As in R-3.2.0: <CODE>configure</CODE> options <span class="option">--with-system-zlib</span>,
<span class="option">--with-system-bzlib</span> and <span class="option">--with-system-pcre</span> are
now the default.  For the time being there is fallback to the
versions included in the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> sources if no system versions are
found or (unlikely) if they are too old.
</p>
<p>Linux users should check that the <code>-devel</code> or <code>-dev</code>
versions of packages <span class="pkg">zlib</span>, <span class="pkg">bzip2</span>/<span class="pkg">libbz2</span> and
<span class="pkg">pcre</span> as well as <span class="pkg">xz-devel</span>/<span class="pkg">liblzma-dev</span> (or
similar names) are installed.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> New versions of the C matrix multiply functions are now used, which
take advantage of SIMD instructions on Intel/AMD processors, and
which may perform operations in parallel using helper threads (when
these are enabled).  
</p>
<p>These routines will (if built properly) produce exactly the
same results as naive matrix multiplication routines in which
each element of the result is computed as a dot product of two
vectors, with the dot products computed by sequentially summing
products of elements.  NA and NaN values are therefore propagated
properly, and roundoff errors are the same as for the naive
method (which is the same as the variant of the reference BLAS 
routines that are supplied with pqR).
</p>
<p>Partly because of this desire to maintain reproducibility,
these routines are not always as fast as the multiplication
routines in optimized BLAS packages such as openBLAS.
Performance is generally less than a factor of two worse than
these optimized BLAS routines, however, and in some contexts
performance is actually better.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The radix sorting procedure introduced in R-3.3.1 is now available
in pqR.  The R-3.3.1 NEWS entry regarding this was as follows:
</p>
<p>The radix sort algorithm and implementation from
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table"><span class="pkg">data.table</span></a> (<code>forder</code>) replaces the previous
radix (counting) sort and adds a new method for
<code>order()</code>.  Contributed by Matt Dowle and Arun
Srinivasan, the new algorithm supports logical, integer (even
with large values), real, and character vectors.  It
outperforms all other methods, but there are some caveats (see
<code>?sort</code>).
</p>
<p>Some other changes in <code>sort</code> and <code>order</code> from later R Core
releases (to R-3.4.1) have also been incorporated.
</p>
<p>A new merge sort procedure has been implemented, and is used by 
default in those cases where radix sort is not suitable.  The
previous shellshort procedure is still available, and is used by
default for short numerical vectors.  Shellsort is generally
slower than merge sort for longer vectors, though it does have 
the advantage of not allocating any auxiliary storage.  Whether to use
merge sort or shellsort can now be specified for <code>rank</code>,
and <code>"merge"</code> is now an option for the method arguments of
<code>order</code>, <code>sort.int</code>, and <code>sort.list</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Operations that increase or decrease the length of a vector
(including lists) now often make changes in place, rather than
allocating a new vector.  A small amount of additional
memory is sometimes allocated at the end of a vector to allow
expansion without reallocation.  This improvement mirrors a
recent improvement in R-3.4.0, but applies in more situations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>c</code> function will sometimes use the space allocated to its
first argument for the result, after extending it in place.  
In assigments like <code>v&lt;-c(v,x)</code>, the space for <code>v</code>
may be extended and <code>x</code> copied into it in place.
The copying needed by <code>c</code> may now sometimes be done in
parallel in a helper thread.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Subsetting an unclassed object now does not cause a copy of
the object to be made.  For example, the following do not
require copying <code>obj</code>:
</p>
<PRE>    x &lt;- unclass(obj)[-1]; y &lt;- unclass(obj)[[1]]
</PRE>
<code>help(unclass)</code> now documents what operations on 
<code>unclass(obj)</code> do not require copying.  Note that with
this improvement, there is now no reason to use <code>.subset</code>
or <code>.subset2</code>.
</li>
<li><p> The <code>sample</code> (and <code>sample.int</code>) functions have been
sped up.  The improvement can be enormous when sampling a small 
number of items from a much larger set, without replacement,
due to use of a hashing scheme.  Hashing is done
automatically whenever it appears to be advantageous, and
does not change the result. (A somewhat similar hashing scheme 
was introduced in R Core versions from R-3.0.0, but it gives 
different results, and hence is enabled by default only for very 
large sets.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>paste</code> and <code>paste0</code> functions have been sped up.
They are now about two to six times
faster than in R-3.4.0, and are usually faster than the 
<code>stri_paste</code> function from the <code>stringi</code> package.
Pasting with an integer vector is now done without converting
it to an intermediate string vector.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Substring extraction and replacement with <code>substr</code> or
<code>substring</code> has also been sped up for long strings.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Conversion of integer, double, and logical values to strings,
and vice versa, has been sped up, in some cases enormously.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>serialize</code> and <code>unserialize</code> functions have been
sped up, particularly when the default &quot;XDR&quot; format is used.
The old, slow, and cumbersome XDR routines written by Sun are
no longer used. The advantage of using the <code>xdr=FALSE</code>
option to <code>serialize</code> is now quite small.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0 (with further pqR improvements): 
The <code>@&lt;-</code> operator is now implemented as a primitive, which should
reduce some copying of objects when used.  Note that the operator
object must now be in package base: do not try to import it
explicitly from package methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Relational operators are now faster, and may sometimes be done in 
helper threads (though currently without pipelining of data).
Computations such as <code>sum(vec&gt;0)</code> are now done with a
merged procedure that avoids creating <code>vec&gt;0</code> as an intermediate
value.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of the logical operators (<code>!</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>|</code>)
has been improved for long vectors, and they may now be done
in a helper thread (though currently without pipelining of data).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many 1-argument math functions (such as <code>exp</code> and <code>sin</code>)
are now sometimes computed in parallel using two threads 
(possibly running in parallel with the master thread).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Creation of matrices with <code>matrix</code> is now faster.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Division of a vector by a scalar real or integer value of 2 is now
automatically converted to a faster multiplication by 0.5 (which
produces exactly the same result).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Creation of arrays with <code>array</code> is now usually done with
a faster internal routine, mimicking (with improvements) changes
in R-2.15.2 and later R Core versions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>which.min</code>, and <code>which.max</code> functions have been
sped up, especially for logical and integer arguments (partially
using code from R-3.2.3, with improvements).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>rep</code> function is now often faster for string vectors,
and for vectors of any type that have names.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Improved methods for symbol lookup are now used, which increase
speed in many contexts, and especially in functions that are
defined in packages (rather than in the global workspace).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>get</code> and <code>mget</code> functions have been sped up.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>package::symbol</code> and <code>package:::symbol</code>
has been improved, especially when the package is <code>base</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>nchar</code> has been greatly improved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>substr</code> has been improved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>which</code> has been improved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>.Call</code> has been improved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> has been improved,
for cases when many elements need to be checked to determine
the result.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>substitute</code> has been improved for many
cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>pmin</code> and <code>pmax</code> has been improved,
especially when they have only two arguments.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Input and output have been sped up, sometimes considerably,
both with regard to low-level character io, and with respect to 
output formatting.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Subscripting with a logical vector is now faster for long vectors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting names on a vector has now been sped up in many cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Calls to LAPACK routines in the base package are now done with
<code>.Internal</code> rather than <code>.Call</code>, which provides a 
noticeable speedup for operations on small matrices.  This is
similar to a change made in R-3.0.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>grep</code>, <code>grepl</code>, <code>sub</code>, and <code>gsub</code> functions
have been speeded up, substantially in some situations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>rbind</code> for data frames has been improved for
simple cases where all arguments are simple data frames with
columns that are atomic vectors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Merging of arithmetic operations on vectors has been streamlined,
with consequent reduction in code size.  Now only the <code>abs</code>
function may be merged (not other one-argument math functions),
and <code>^</code> is merged only when the second operand is 2.  
The first operation in a merged sequence can now sometimes be
on two vectors (merged operations are otherwise restricted to
operating on a vector and a scalar).  Division can now
only be the last operation in a merged sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Tasks that may be mergable with later tasks are now by default
scheduled with a &quot;hold&quot; option, which prevents them from being
started immediately in a helper thread (which would make a merge
impossible).  They are instead eligible to be done in a helper
thread only when a merge is no longer possible, or the result
becomes needed, or the master thread starts what is recognized 
as being a long computation (currently only garbage collection).  
This behaviour can be disabled with the <code>helpers_no_holding</code>
option (see <code>help(options)</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> General interpretive overhead has been reduced in some contexts,
particularly when extracting or replacing subsets with 
<code>[.]</code> or <code>[[.]]</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> It is no longer necessary to avoid putting the <code>else</code>
clause of an unenclosed <code>if</code> statement at the start of a line 
when code is read from a file with <code>source</code> or
<code>parse</code>, or is parsed from a vector of character strings,
or is run with <code>Rscript</code>, or when the <code>--peek-for-else</code>
option is used when starting an R session.  In interactive sessions,
it is still by default necessary to not start an <code>else</code> clause 
on a new line, since in that context checking whether an <code>else</code> 
is on the next line would require waiting for the user to input a
line which they may not intend to enter.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Character pasting operations can now be written more concisely using
new binary operators <code>!</code> and <code>!!</code>, with <code>a !! b</code>
equivalent to <code>paste(a,b)</code> and <code>a ! b</code> equivalent
to <code>paste0(a,b)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>along</code>, <code>across</code>, and <code>down</code> forms of 
the <code>for</code> statement (introduced in pqR-2016-06-24 and
pqR-2016-10-05) now set the loop variable(s) to the
corresponding length or dimension size when the loop is done
zero times, rather than to <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> An attempt is now made to get <code>seek</code> to work on text files
when re-encoding is done, but it's possible that some anomalies
could arise.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Previously, when a scalar was extracted from a matrix or array 
with <code>[]</code>, a name derived from a dimension name was attached
to it only if a single dimension had names (though this was not 
correctly documented by <code>help("[")</code>, and is not correctly
documented in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.0).  This behaviour has
been changed in pqR so that a name is attached when two dimensions
have names provided one of these dimensions had dropping suppressed.
This gives reliable results when matrices happen to have only one
row or column, as illustrated by the last example in <code>help("[")</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When <code>unlist</code> is applied to an atomic vector, names are now removed
if <code>use.names</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (not the default).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>text</code> argument of <code>parse</code> is now coerced to a 
character vector using <code>as.character</code>, with possible method
dispatch.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>memory.profile</code> function now has an argument that can
restrict the counts for vector objects to only those of some minimum
length.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>Rprofmemt</code> function now has a <code>bytes</code> argument, which
can be set to <code>FALSE</code> to suppress output of the number of bytes
allocated (useful for producing platform-independent output).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When the <code>unlist</code> and <code>c</code> functions create names for their
result, the situations in which a sequence number is appended to a 
name are now the same for atomic vectors and lists.  For example, 
<code>unlist(list(x=list(2,a=3)))</code> and <code>unlist(list(x=c(2,a=3)))</code>
now return the same result (in which the name for the first element 
is <code>x</code>, not <code>x1</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is now no longer possible to create an S4 object with a vector
data part and a slot called &quot;names&quot; that is not a 
character vector.  This was previously allowed
(and is in R-3.5.1), but didn't really work, as illustrated 
below: 
</p>
<PRE>  &gt; setClass("X",representation(names="logical"),prototype(1,names=c(T,F)))
  &gt; a &lt;- new("X")
  &gt; a@names
  [1]  TRUE FALSE
  &gt; b &lt;- a+1
  &gt; b@names
  Error: no slot of name "names" for this object of class "cl"
</PRE>
However, completely consistent behaviour in this regard is still 
not enforced.
</li>
<li><p> A <code>slots</code> argument that is a named character vector is now
allowed for <code>setClass</code>, to provide some compatibility with
extensions to the <code>methods</code> package in R-3.0.0, prior to fully
porting those extensions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The warning message &quot;restarting interrupted promise evaluation&quot; is
no longer produced.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>%%</code> operator can no longer produce a warning of
&quot;probable complete loss of accuracy in modulus&quot;, the possiblity
of which had prevented it being done in parallel in a helper thread.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and <code>tan</code> functions no longer produce
a warning message when they return <code>NA</code> when given <code>Inf</code>
as their argument, the possiblity of which had prevented them being
done in parallel in a helper thread.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>inhibit_release</code> argument to the <code>gctorture2</code> function,
and the <code>R_GCTORTURE_INHIBIT_RELEASE</code> environment variable,
can now (as earlier, and in R Core versions of R) be used to prevent 
freed objects from being reused.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>cumsum</code> and <code>cumprod</code> functions now correctly propagate 
<code>NaN</code> and <code>NA</code> values that are encountered to all later
values, with <code>NA</code> taking precedence over <code>NaN</code>.  Previously,
<code>NaN</code> had been converted to <code>NA</code> in <code>cumsum</code>.  (In
R-3.5.0, the behaviour in this respect appears to be platform 
dependent.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Indexes used with <code>[[</code> can be symbols, with effect equivalent 
to indexing with the symbol's print name.  This has actually been
true since pqR-2013-07-22, but wasn't documented.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When applied to complex vectors, the <code>prod</code> and <code>cumprod</code>
functions now produce results matching those obtained with the
<code>*</code> operator.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The old serialization format, used prior to December 2001, is 
no longer supported in pqR.  Code to support it would need to
be changed to accomodate recent changes in pqR, and meaningful
testing of such changes seems like it would require excessive
efforts.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is now allowed to set the length of an &ldquo;expression&rdquo;
object with <code>length(e)&lt;-len</code>, as for other vector
types.  Any extra elements are set to <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Attempts to set attributes on a symbol are now silently ignored,
both at the R level, with <code>attr</code> and <code>attributes</code>, and
at the C API level, with <code>SET_ATTRIB</code>.  Getting the attributes
of a symbol returns NULL.  Previously (and also in R-3.4.0),
attributes could be attached to symbols, but they were lost
when a workspace was saved and restored.  Attaching attributes
to symbols is now also disallowed in R-3.5.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is no longer a <code>SET_PRINTNAME</code> function available in
the C API (even if internal header files are used).  Setting the 
print name of a symbol has never been
a safe or reasonable thing to do.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The default <code>size</code> for <code>new.env</code> is now <code>NA</code>, which
gives an internal default, which now varies depending on the
platform and configuration options.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assigning to <code>...</code> or <code>..1</code>, <code>..2</code>, etc. with
<code>&lt;-</code> and other assignment operators is no longer allowed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A warning is no longer generated when the first argument of
<code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>, <code>.Call</code>, or <code>.External</code> is
given its proper name of <code>.NAME</code>.  For the moment, the first
argument is also allowed to be called &quot;name&quot;, though this is deprecated.
Passing more than one <code>PACKAGE</code>, <code>NAOK</code>, <code>DUP</code>, 
<code>HELPERS</code>, or <code>ENCODING</code> argument now results in an error 
rather than a warning. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is now a <code>helpers_no_holding</code> option; see note above
under performance improvements.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The defensive measures against code that incorrectly modifies arguments
to <code>.Call</code>, which were introduced in pqR-2016-10-05, have been
extended, so that scalar function arguments that appear to reference
shared data may now also be duplicated.  Note that this defensive
measure should not be relied upon - code called with <code>.Call</code>
should modify objects only after confirming that they are not shared.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> [ Following changes from R Core releases described below: ]
ICU is not used by default for collation if the initial locale 
is <code>"C"</code> or <code>"POSIX"</code>; the C <code>strcmp</code> function
is used instead, as when <code>icuSetCollate(locale="ASCII")</code> 
has been called.  This default may of course be changed using
<code>icuSetCollate</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is now a <code>"first"</code> option for the filter used by
<code>available.packages</code>, which takes the package found in the
earliest repository, regardless of version.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>boot</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 1.3-9 (named 1.3-9-909 since it is slightly tweaked).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>digest</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 0.6.18 (named 0.6.18-909 since it is slightly tweaked).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>KernSmooth</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 2.23-15.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>class</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 7.3-5.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>lattice</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 0.20-29.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>mgcv</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 1.7-24.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>nlme</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 3.1-107.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>nnet</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 7.3-12.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>rpart</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 4.1-13.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>spatial</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 7.3-5.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The version of the <code>survival</code> package included as a recommended
package is now 2.37-7.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES FROM R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: New simple <code>provideDimnames()</code>
utility function.  From R-3.2.4: <code>provideDimnames()</code>
gets an optional <code>unique</code> argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: <code>mget()</code> now has a default for <code>envir</code> (the 
frame from which it is called), for consistency with <code>get()</code> and
<code>assign()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: The <code>R_forceSymbols</code> function, which disallows
calls of C functions via names given by character strings, is now 
implemented, as described in <code>R-exts</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: New <code>assertCondition()</code>, etc. utilities in tools,
useful for testing.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> An <code>anyNA</code> function is now provided, defined simply as
<code>function (x) any(is.na(x))</code> (which is fast in pqR).
This is useful only for compatibility with the <code>anyNA</code>
function introduced in R-3.1.0.  The <code>recursive</code> argument
to <code>anyNA</code> introduced in R-3.2.0 is not implemented.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.0: The way the unary operators (<code>+ - !</code>) handle
attributes is now more consistent.  If there is no coercion,
all attributes (including class) are copied from the input to
the result: otherwise only names, dims and dimnames are.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: There is a new function <code>rep_len()</code> analogous to 
<code>rep.int()</code> for when speed is required (and names are not).
</p>
<p>Note, however, that in pqR <code>rep</code> is as fast as
<code>rep_len</code> (and also <code>rep.int</code>) when there are no names.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.2: <code>capabilities()</code> now reports if ICU is
compiled in for use for collation (it is only actually used if
a suitable locale is set for collation, and never for a
<code>C</code> locale).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.2: <code>icuSetCollate()</code> allows <code>locale = "default"</code>,
and <code>locale = "none"</code> to use OS services rather than ICU for
collation.
</p>
<p>Environment variable <span class="env">R_ICU_LOCALE</span> can be used to set the
default ICU locale, in case the one derived from the OS locale is
inappropriate (this is currently necessary on Windows).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.2: New function <code>icuGetCollate()</code> to report on the ICU
collation locale in use (if any).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.3: <code>icuSetCollate()</code> now accepts <code>locale = "ASCII"</code>
which uses the basic C function <code>strcmp</code> and so collates
strings byte-by-byte in numerical order.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.2.0: New function <code>trimws()</code> for removing leading/trailing
whitespace.  The pqR version is modified to slightly improve speed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.2.0: New <code>get0()</code> function, combining <code>exists()</code> and
<code>get()</code> in one call, for efficiency.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.2.0: New function <code>.getNamespaceInfo()</code>, a
no-check version of <code>getNamespaceInfo()</code> mostly for
internal speedups.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.3.0: New function <code>strrep()</code> for repeating the elements
of a character vector.  The pqR version has a significantly faster
implementation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.3.0: New programmeR's utility function <code>chkDots()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.3.0: New string utilities <code>startsWith(x, prefix)</code> and
<code>endsWith(x, suffix)</code>.  (However, in pqR, <code>NULL</code> arguments
are allowed, and are treated the same as zero-length character vectors.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>lengths</code> function has been ported from R Core releases
which had NEWS items as below:
</p>
<p>R-3.2.0: New <code>lengths()</code> function for getting the lengths
of all elements in a list.
</p>
<p>R-3.2.1: <code>lengths(x)</code> now also works (trivially) for
atomic <code>x</code> and hence can be used more generally as an
efficient replacement of <code>sapply(x, length)</code> and similar.
</p>
<p>R-3.3.0: <code>lengths()</code> considers methods for <code>length</code>
and <code>[[</code> on <code>x</code>, so it should work automatically on
any objects for which appropriate methods on those generics
are defined.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.5.0: If <span class="option">--default-packages</span> is not used, then
<CODE>Rscript</CODE> now checks the environment variable
<span class="env">R_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_PACKAGES</span>. If this is set, then it takes
precedence over <span class="env">R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES</span>. If default packages are
not specified on the command line or by one of these environment
variables, then <CODE>Rscript</CODE> now uses the same default
packages as <CODE>R</CODE>. For now, the previous behavior of not
including <span class="pkg">methods</span> can be restored by setting the environment
variable <span class="env">R_SCRIPT_LEGACY</span> to <span class="samp">yes</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The C macros <code>MAYBE_SHARED</code>, <code>NO_REFERENCES</code>, 
<code>MAYBE_REFERENCED</code>, <code>NOT_SHARED</code>, and <code>MARK_MUTABLE</code>
have been added to &lsquo;<span class="file">Rinternals.h</span>&rsquo;, for compatibility with
recent R Core versions.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A long-known &quot;bug&quot; that was tolerated for performance reasons
is no longer tolerated.  Previously, values for arguments of functions
or operators could be changed by evaluation of later operators, as
illustrated below:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; a&lt;-c(10,20); a+(a[2]&lt;-7)
    [1] 17 14</PRE>
The result is now (correctly) a vector with elements 17 and 27.  This
is also fixed in R-3.5, but without this being documented (as far as I
can see).
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs in the deparser related to the following, reported on r-devel
by Martin Binder in July 2017:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; (expr = substitute(-a * 10, list(a = quote(if (TRUE) 1 else 0))))
    -if (TRUE) 1 else 0 * 10
</PRE>
The deparsed expression printed does not parse to the actual expression.
After the fix, the output is now
<PRE>    (-if (TRUE) 1 else 0) * 10</PRE>
This bug remains in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which <code>pmin(NA,0/0)</code> produced <code>NaN</code> as
its result, rather than <code>NA</code>, which <code>help(pmin)</code> implies
should be the result.  This bug also exists in R Core versions 
to at least R-3.5.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which setting names could cause a quoted expression
to be evaluated, illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; abc &lt;- 1:2; b &lt;- quote(cat("Hi!\n")); names(abc) &lt;- b
    Hi!
    &gt; abc
    &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 
       1    2 
</PRE>
The <code>cat</code> function is now no longer called, and the names
attached to <code>abc</code> are now <code>"cat"</code> and <code>"Hi!\n"</code>,
the correct conversion of the quoted expression to a character
vector.  This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug illustrated by the following code:
</p>
<PRE>    p&lt;-matrix(c(2L,3L,2L,2L),1,4); p[,p]&lt;-1L; p
</PRE>
This previously produced a matrix with values 1, 1, 2, 2 rather than the
correct answer of 2, 1, 1, 2.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by
<code>deparse(as.integer(c(2^31-1,NA,-(2^31-1))))</code>
producing incorrect output.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs illustrated by <code>format(3.1,width=9999)</code>, in which
large field widths are reduced to 999, but are filled with only spaces.
The field widths are now automatically reduced to 999 (2000 for
complex values), but contain correct data.  This bug was also
fixed (differently) in R-3.1.3, except for complex values.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that caused the following to fail with an error,
rather than print the square root of two:
</p>
<PRE>    f &lt;- function (...) ..1(2); f(sqrt)
</PRE>
This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs in which <code>as.numeric("0x1.1.1p0")</code> didn't give an error,
and <code>as.numeric("0x1fffffffffffff.7ffp0")</code> gave an 
incorrectly-rounded result.  Both bugs (and related ones previously
fixed in pqR) exist in R-3.5.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that caused
<code>print(c(F,NA,NA,F),na.print="abcdef")</code> to
produce incorrectly-formatted output.  This bug also exists in
R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation on <code>debug</code> and <code>debugonce</code> has been
fixed to remove mention of the <code>text</code> and <code>condition</code> 
arguments. These arguments were documented in R-2.10.0, and in 
subsequent R Core versions, but at least to R-3.4.1, they have never 
been implemented as documented, but rather have always been 
completely ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed two pqR bugs illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- c(2,3); e &lt;- new.env(); e[["x"]] &lt;- a; a[2] &lt;- 9; e$x[2]
    L &lt;- list(1,2); y &lt;- list(2+1); L[2] &lt;- y; y[[1]][1] &lt;- 9; L[[2]]
</PRE>
For both lines above, the value printed was 9 rather than 3.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug in which the <code>evaluate</code> argument to <code>dump</code>
was interpreted backwards.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug in which <code>parse</code> sometimes produced parse data
in which an <code>if</code> expression at the end of a line was said to 
end at the start of the next line.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug in which the &quot;parent&quot; column returned by 
<code>getParseData</code> could be of double rather than integer type.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Previously, <code>length(plist)&lt;-n</code> did not work when <code>plist</code>
was a pairlist, but it does now.  This bug was also fixed independently
in R-3.4.3.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    L &lt;- list(c(3,4))
    M &lt;- matrix(L,2,2)
    M[[1,1]][1] &lt;- 9
    L
</PRE>
In the value printed for <code>L</code>, <code>L[[1]][1]</code> had changed to 9.
This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- as.integer(NA); e &lt;- new.env(size=a); print(a)
</PRE>
The value printed was previously 0 rather than NA.
This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least R-3.5.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that caused a crash (rather than an error message)
for code like the following:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- quote(r&lt;-1); a[[2]] &lt;- character(0); eval(a)
</PRE>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES FROM R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2: <code>R CMD build --resave-data</code> could fail if there 
was no &lsquo;<span class="file">data</span>&rsquo; directory but there was an &lsquo;<span class="file">R/sysdata.rda</span>&rsquo;
file. (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14947">PR#14947</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Similarly to R-3.1.2, <code>as.environment(list())</code> and 
<code>list2env(list())</code> now work, and as.list() of such an
environment (or any empty environment) now gives an
empty list with no names, the same as <code>list()</code>. (PR#15926)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.5.0: <code>dist(x, method = "canberra")</code> now uses the correct
definition; the result may only differ when <code>x</code> contains
values of differing signs, e.g. not for 0-1 data.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: <code>deparse()</code> now deparses raw vectors in a form that
is syntactically correct. (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15369">PR#15369</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.5.0 <code>Rscript</code> can now accept more than one argument given 
on the <span class="samp">#!</span> line of a script. Previously, one could only pass a
single argument on the <span class="samp">#!</span> line in Linux.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2017-06-09</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> pqR now uses a new garbage collector and new schemes for memory
layout.  Objects are represented more compactly, much more compactly
if &ldquo;compressed pointers&rdquo; are used. Garbage collection is faster,
and will have a more localized memory access/write pattern, which
may be of significance for cache performance and for performance with
functions like <code>mclapply</code> from the <code>parallel</code> package.
</p>
<p>The new garbage collection scheme uses a general-purpose Segmented
Generational Garbage Collector, the source code for which is at
https://gitlab.com/radfordneal/sggc
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> There is now an <code>--enable-compressed-pointers</code> option to
<code>configure</code>.  When included, pqR will be built with 
32-bit compressed pointers, which considerably reduces
memory usage (especially if many small objects are used) 
on a system with 64-bit pointers (slightly on
a system with 32-bit pointers).  Use of compressed pointers
results in a speed penalty on some tasks of up to about 30%,
while on other tasks the lower memory usage may improve speed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is now an <code>--enable-aux-for-attrib</code> option to
<code>configure</code>.  This is ignored if 
<code>--enable-compressed-pointers</code> is used, or if the platform
does not use 64-bit pointers.  Otherwise, it results in 
attributes for objects being stored as &ldquo;auxiliary information&rdquo;,
which allows for some objects to be stored more compactly,
with some possible speed and memory advantages, though some operations
become slightly slower.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Packages containing C code must be installed with a build of
pqR configured with the same setting of
<code>--enable-compressed-pointers</code> or
<code>--enable-aux-for-attrib</code> as the build of pqR in which
they are used.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--enable-strict-barrier</code> option to <code>configure</code>
has been removed.  In pqR, usages in C code such as <code>CAR(x)=y</code>
cause compile errors regardless of this option, so it is not
needed for that purpose.  The use of this option to enable the 
<code>PROTECTCHECK</code> feature will be replaced by a similar feature
in a future pqR release.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION AND FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Documentation in the &ldquo;R Installation and Administration&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;R Internals&rdquo; manuals has
been updated to reflect the new garbage collection and memory
layout schemes.  There are also updates to <code>help(Memory)</code>,
<code>help("Memory-limits")</code>, and <code>help(gc)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The format of the output of <code>gc</code> has changed, to reflect
the characteristics of the new garbage collector.  See
<code>help(gc)</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Memory allocated by a C function using <code>R_alloc</code> will no
longer appear in output of <code>Rprofmem</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>pages</code> argument for Rprofmem is now ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The output of <code>.Internal(inspect(x))</code> now includes both the
uncompressed and the compressed pointers to <code>x</code>, and other
information relevant to the new scheme, while omitting
some information that was specific to the previous garbage collector.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>CHANGES TO THE C API</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>SETLENGTH</code> function now performs some checks to avoid
possible disaster.  Its use is still discouraged.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The probably never-used <code>call_R</code> and <code>call_S</code> functions
have been disabled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is now illegal to set the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; value associated with a symbol
to anything other than a primitive function (<code>BUILTINSXP</code>
or <code>SPECIALSXP</code> type).  The <code>INTERNAL</code> values are no longer
stored in symbol objects, but in a separate table, with the
consequence that it may not be possible to use <code>SET_INTERNAL</code>
for a symbol that was not given an internal value during initialization.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Passing a non-vector object to a C function using <code>.C</code> is now
even less advisable than before.  If compressed pointers are used,
this will work only if the argument is recevied as a <code>void*</code>
pointer, then cast to <code>uintptr_t</code>, then to <code>SEXP</code> (this
should work when SEXP is either a compressed an uncompressed 
pointer).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Cross-references between manuals in doc/manual, such as R-admin.html
and R-exts.html,
now go to the other manuals in the same place.  Previously (and
in current R core versions), they went to the manuals of that
name at cran.r-project.org, even when those manuals are not for
the same version of R.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2016-10-24</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a small maintenance release, fixing a few bugs and installation
problems.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> When building pqR on a Mac, some Mac-specific source files
are now compiled with the default 'gcc' (really clang on
recent Macs), regardless of what C compiler has been specified
for other uses.  This is necessary to bypass problems with
Apple-supplied header files on El Capitan and Sierra. There are
also a few other tweaks to building on a Mac.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Some bugs have been fixed involving the interaction of finalizers
and active bindings with some pqR optimizations, one of which
showed up when building with clang on a Mac.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2016-10-05</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> With this release, pqR, which was based on R-2.15.0, now incorporates
the new features, bug fixes, and some relevant performance improvements
from R-2.15.1.  The pqR version number 
has been advanced to 2.15.1 to reflect this.  (This version number is
checked when trying to install packages.)
</p>
<p>Note that there could still be incompatibilities with packages
that work with R-2.15.1, either because of bugs in pqR, or because
a package may rely on a bug that is fixed in pqR, or because
pqR implements some changes from R Core versions after R-2.15.1 that
are not compatibile with R-2.15.1, or because some new
pqR features are not totally compatible with R-2.15.1.
</p>
<p>Since many features from later R Core versions are also implemented
in pqR, some packages that state a dependence on a later version
of R might nevertheless work with pqR, if the dependence declaration in
the DESCRIPTION file is changed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The 'digest' package (by Dirk Eddelbuettel and others) is now
included in the release as a recommended package (which will
therefore be available without having to install it).  The version 
used is based on digest_0.6.10, with a slight modification to
correctly handle pqR's constant objects (hence called digest_0.6.10.1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The pqR package repository (see information at pqR-project.org) has
now been updated to include some packages (or new versions of packages)
that depend on R-2.15.1, which were previously not included.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There are also some new pqR features and performance improvements
in this release, including
<code>across</code> and <code>down</code> options for <code>for</code> statements, a
less error-prone scheme for protecting objects from garbage 
collection in C code, and faster implementations of subset 
replacement with <code>[ ]</code>, <code>[[ ]]</code>, and <code>$</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The direction of growth of the C stack is no longer determined
at runtime.  Instead, it is assumed by default to grow downwards,
as is the case for virtually all current platforms.  This can
be overridden when building pqR by including <code>-DR_CStackDir=-1</code>
in <code>CFLAGS</code>.  See the R-admin manual for more details.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>for</code> statement now has <code>down</code> and <code>across</code>
forms, which conveniently iterate over the rows 
(<code>down</code>) or columns (<code>across</code>) of a matrix.  See
<code>help("for")</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> C functions called from R (by <code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code>) 
can now protect objects from garbage collection using a new, 
less error-prone, method, rather than the old (and still present)
<code>PROTECT</code> and <code>UNPROTECT</code> calls.  See the section titled
&ldquo;Handling the effects of garbage collection&rdquo; (5.9.1) in the &ldquo;Writing 
R Exensions&rdquo; manual for details on the new facility, as well as
improved documentation on the old facilities.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>serialize</code> and <code>saveRDS</code> functions now take a 
<code>nosharing</code> argument, which defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.  When
<code>nosharing</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, constant objects (and perhaps in 
future other shared objects) are serialized as if they were not
shared.  This is used in the modified 'digest' package included
with the release to ensure that objects that are the same according
to <code>identical</code> will have identical serializations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The default for the <code>last</code> argument of <code>substring</code> is
now <code>.Machine$integer.max</code>.  The previous default was 1000000
(and still is in R-3.3.1), which made absolutely no sense, and
is likely responsible for bugs in user code that assumes that,
for example, <code>substring(s,2)</code> will always return a string like
<code>s</code> but without the first character, regardless of how many
characters are in <code>s</code>.  This assumption will now actually be true.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Since assignments like <code>"1A"&lt;-c(3,4)</code> are allowed, for consistency,
pqR now also allows assignments like <code>"1A"[2]&lt;-10</code>.  However,
it is recommended that if a symbol that is not syntactically valid
must be used, it should be written with backquotes, as in
<code>`1A`[2]&lt;-10</code>.  This will work on the right-hand side too,
and is also a bit faster.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>.Call</code> and <code>.External</code> now take a defensive measure
against C code that incorrectly assumes that the value stored
in a variable will not be shared with other variables.  If
<code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code> is passed a simple variable as
an argument, and the value of that variable is a scalar without
attributes that is shared with another variable
(ie, <code>NAMED</code> is greater than 1), this value is duplicated and
reassigned before the C function is called.  This is a defense against
incorrect usage, and should not be relied on &mdash; instead, the
incorrect usage should be fixed.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Replacing part of a vector or list with <code>[ ]</code>, <code>[[ ]]</code>,
and <code>$</code> is now often faster.  The improvement can be by up to 
a factor two or more when the index and replacement value are scalars.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In some contexts, the <code>unclass</code> function now takes 
negligible time, with no copying of the object that is unclassed.
In particular this is the case when <code>unclass(x)</code> is the object
of a <code>for</code> statement, the operand of an arithmetic operator,
the argument of a univariate mathematical function, or the 
argument of <code>length</code>.  For example, in
</p>
<PRE>    `+.myclass` &lt;- function (e1, e2)
        (unclass(e1) + unclass(e2)) %% 100
</PRE>  
the two calls of <code>unclass</code> do not require duplicating
<code>e1</code> or <code>e2</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Arithmetic with a mixture of complex and real/integer operands
is now faster.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed some problems with reporting of missing arguments to functions,
which were introduced in pqR-2016-06-24.  For example, 
</p>
<PRE>    f &lt;- function(x) x; g &lt;- function(y) f(y); g()
</PRE>
would not display an error message, when it should.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem affecting mixed complex and real/integer arithmetic
when the result is directly assigned to one of the operands,
illustrated by
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- 101:110; b &lt;- (1:10)+0i; a &lt;- a-b; a
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug involving invalid UTF-8 byte sequences,
which was introduced in R-2.15.1, and is present in later
R Core releases to at least R-3.3.1.  The bug is illustrated by
the following code, which results in an infinite loop in the
interpreter, when run on a Linux system in a UTF-8 locale:
</p>
<PRE>    plot(0); text(1,0,"ab\xc3")
</PRE>
The code from R-2.15.1 causing the bug was incorporated into
this release of pqR, but the problem was fixed after the
fBasics package was seen to fail with a test release of pqR,
so the bug does not appear in any stable release of pqR.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed misinformation in help(length) about the length of
expressions (which is also present in R Core versions to 
at least R-3.3.1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The usage in <code>help("[[")</code> now shows that the replacement
form can take more than one index (for arrays). 
(This is also missing in R Core versions to at least R-3.3.1.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES FROM R CORE VERSIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: source() now uses withVisible() rather than
.Internal(eval.with.vis).  This sometimes alters tracebacks
slightly.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: splineDesign() and spline.des() in package
splines have a new option sparse which can be used for efficient
construction of a sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: norm() now allows type = &quot;2&quot; (the spectral or 2-norm)
as well, mainly for didactical completeness.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually implemented in pqR-2014-09-30, but not
noted in NEWS then): 
colorRamp() (and hence colorRampPalette()) now also works for the
boundary case of just one color when the ramp is flat.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually implemented in pqR-2014-09-30, but not
noted in NEWS then): 
For tiff(type = &quot;windows&quot;), the numbering of per-page files
except the last was off by one.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually implemented in pqR-2014-09-30, but not
noted in NEWS then):
For R CMD check, a few people have reported problems with
junctions on Windows (although they were tested on Windows 7, XP
and Server 2008 machines and it is unknown under what
circumstances the problems occur).  Setting the environment
variable R_WIN_NO_JUNCTIONS to a non-empty value (e.g. in
~/.R/check.Renviron) will force copies to be used instead.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 and later R Core versions:
More cases in which merge() could create a data frame with
duplicate column names now give warnings.  Cases where names
specified in by match multiple columns are errors.  [ Plus
other tweaks from later versions. ]
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: Added Polish translations by Łukasz Daniel.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS FROM R CORE VERSIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
In package parallel, makeForkCluster() and the multicore-based
functions use native byte-order for serialization.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
lm.fit(), lm.wfit(), glm.fit() and lsfit() do less copying of
objects, mainly by using .Call() rather than .Fortran().
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
tabulate() makes use of .C(DUP = FALSE) and hence does not copy
bin.  (Suggested by Tim Hesterberg.)  It also avoids making a
copy of a factor argument bin.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
Other functions (often or always) doing less copying include
cut(), dist(), the complex case of eigen(), hclust(), image(),
kmeans(), loess(), stl() and svd(LINPACK = TRUE).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN R CORE VERSIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
Nonsense uses such as seq(1:50, by = 5) (from package plotrix)
and seq.int(1:50, by = 5) are now errors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The residuals in the 5-number summary printed by summary() on an
&quot;lm&quot; object are now explicitly labelled as weighted residuals
when non-constant weights are present.  (Wish of PR#14840.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The plot() method for class &quot;stepfun&quot; only used the optional xval
argument to compute xlim and not the points at which to plot (as
documented).  (PR#14864)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
hclust() is now fast again (as up to end of 2003), with a
different fix for the &quot;median&quot;/&quot;centroid&quot; problem.  (PR#4195).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle
a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
For tiff(type = &quot;windows&quot;), the numbering of per-page files
except the last was off by one.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle
a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The plot() and Axis() methods for class &quot;table&quot; now respect
graphical parameters such as cex.axis.  (Reported by Martin
Becker.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted
from NEWS):  
Under some circumstances package.skeleton() would give out
progress reports that could not be translated and so were
displayed by question marks.  Now they are always in English.
(This was seen for CJK locales on Windows, but may have occurred
elsewhere.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The replacement method for window() now works correctly for
multiple time series of class &quot;mts&quot;.  (PR#14925)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic 
objects such as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted
from NEWS):
Using a string as a ?call? in an error condition with
options(showErrorCalls=TRUE) could cause a segfault.  (PR#14931)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
In legend(), setting some entries of lwd to NA was inconsistent
(depending on the graphics device) in whether it would suppress
those lines; now it consistently does so.  (PR#14926)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
C entry points mkChar and mkCharCE now check that the length of
the string they are passed does not exceed 2^31-1 bytes: they
used to overflow with unpredictable consequences.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
by() failed for a zero-row data frame.  (Reported by Weiqiang
Qian).
</p>
<p>[ Note: When <code>simplify=TRUE</code> (the default), the results 
with zero-row data frames, and more generally when there are
empty subsets, are not particularly sensible, but this has
not been changed in pqR due to compatibility concerns. ]
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
Yates correction in chisq.test() could be bigger than the terms
it corrected, previously leading to an infinite test statistic in
some corner cases which are now reported as NaN.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1 (actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted
from NEWS):
xgettext() and related functions sometimes returned items that
were not strings for translation. (PR#14935)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
plot(&lt;lm&gt;, which=5) now correctly labels the factor level
combinations for the special case where all h[i,i] are the same.
(PR#14837)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2016-06-24</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release extends the R language in ways that address a
set of related flaws in the design of R, and before it S.
</p>
<p>These extensions make it easier to write reliable programs,
by making the easy way to do things also be the correct
way, unlike the previous situation with sequence generation using
the colon operator, and dimension dropping when subsetting arrays.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Several other changes in features are also implemented in this
version, some of which are related to the major language extensions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There are also a few bug fixes, and some improvements in testing,
but no major performance improvements (though some tweaks).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PACKAGE INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> New packages (or other R code) that use the new &ldquo;along&rdquo;
form of the &ldquo;for&rdquo; statement, or which rely on the new
facilities for not dropping dimensions (see below), should not be 
byte compiled, since these features are not supported in
byte-compiled code.  In pqR, using byte compilation is not always
advantageous in any case.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Installation and checking of existing packages may require
setting the environment variable <code>R_PARSE_DOTDOT</code> to
<code>FALSE</code>, so that names with interior sequences of dots
will be accepted (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The base package is no longer byte-compiled, even if pqR is
configured with <code>--enable-byte-compiled-packages</code>, since
it now uses new features not supported by the bytecode compiler.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>MAJOR LANGUAGE EXTENSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> There is a new <code>..</code> operator for generating increasing integer
sequences, which is a less error-prone replacement for the <code>:</code>
operator (which remains for backwards compatibility).  Since <code>..</code>
generates only increasing sequences, it can generate an empty
sequence when the end value is less than the start value, thereby
avoiding some very common bugs that arise when <code>:</code> is used.
</p>
<p>The <code>..</code> operator also has lower precedence than arithmetic
operators (unlike <code>:</code>), which avoids another common set of bugs.
</p>
<p>For example, the following code sets all interior elements of the 
matrix <code>M</code> to zero, that is, all elements except those in the 
first or last row or column:
</p>
<PRE>    for (i in 2..nrow(M)-1)
        for (j in 2..ncol(M)-1)
            M[i,j] &lt;- 0
</PRE>
Without the new <code>..</code> operator, it is awkward to write code
for this task that works correctly when <code>M</code> has two or fewer 
rows, or two or fewer columns.
</li>
<li><p> In order that the <code>..</code> operator can be conveniently used
in contexts such as <code>i..j</code>, consecutive dots are no longer
allowed in names (without using backticks), except at the
beginning or end.  So <code>i..j</code> is not a valid name, but
<code>..i..</code> is valid (though not recommended).  With this restriction
on names, most uses of the <code>..</code> operator are unambiguous even
if it is not surrounded by spaces.  The only exceptions are some uses in
which <code>..</code> is written with a space after it but not before it,
expressions such as <code>i..(a+b)</code>, which is a
call of a function named <code>i..</code>, and expressions such as 
<code>i..-j</code>, which returns the difference between <code>i..</code> and 
<code>j</code>.  Most such uses will be stylistically bad, redundant
(note that the parentheses around <code>a+b</code> above are unnecessary),
or probably unlikely (as is the case for <code>i..-j</code>).
</p>
<p>To accomodate old R code that has consecutive dots within names,
parsing of the <code>..</code> operator can be disabled by setting the
<code>parse_dotdot</code> option to <code>FALSE</code> (with the <code>options</code>
function). The <code>parse_dotdot</code> option defaults to <code>TRUE</code> 
unless the environment variable
<code>R_PARSE_DOTDOT</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code>.  When <code>parse_dotdot</code>
is <code>FALSE</code>, consecutive dots are allowed in names, and <code>..</code>
is not a reserved word.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Another source of bugs is the automatic dropping
of dimensions of size one when subsetting matrices (or 
higher-dimensional arrays) using <code>[]</code>,
unless the <code>drop=FALSE</code> argument is specified.  This frequently
results in code that mostly works, but not when, for example, a data set
has only one observation, or a model uses only one explanatory 
variable.
</p>
<p>To make handling this problem easier, if no <code>drop</code> argument is
specified, pqR now does not drop a dimension of size one if the
subscript for that dimension is a one-dimensional non-logical array.  
For example,
if <code>A</code> is a matrix, <code>A[1..100,array(1)]</code> will produce a
matrix, whereas <code>A[1..100,1]</code> will produce a vector.
</p>
<p>To make this feature more useful, the new <code>..</code> operator 
produces a one-dimensional array, not a bare vector.  So
<code>A[1..n,1..m]</code> will always produce a matrix result, even
when <code>n</code> or <code>m</code> are one.  (It will also correctly
produce an array with zero rows or zero columns when <code>n</code>
or <code>m</code> are zero.)
</p>
<p>This change also applies to subsetting of data frames.  For 
example, <code>df[1..10,1..n]</code> will return a data frame (not a
vector) even when <code>n</code> is one.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Problems with dimensions of size one being dropped also arise
when an entire row, or an entire column, is selected with an empty
(missing) subscript, and there happens to be only one row, or only one 
column.  For example, if <code>A</code> is a matrix with one column, 
<code>A[1:10,]</code> will be a vector, not a matrix.
</p>
<p>To address this problem, pqR now allows a missing argument to
be specified by <code>_</code>, rather than by nothing at all, and
the <code>[]</code> operator (for matrices, arrays, and data frames)
will not drop a dimension if its subscript is <code>_</code>.  So
<code>A[1:10,_]</code> will be a matrix even when <code>A</code> has only
one column.
</p>
<p>R functions that check for a missing argument with the <code>missing</code>
function will see both an empty argument and <code>_</code> as missing,
but can distinguish them using the <code>missing_from_underline</code>
function.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A common use of <code>for</code> statements is to iterate over indexes
of a vector, or row and column indexes of a matrix.  A new type 
of <code>for</code> statement with &ldquo;along&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in&rdquo; now makes
this more convenient.
</p>
<p>For vectors, the form 
</p>
<PRE>    for (i along vec) ...
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>    for (i in seq_along(vec)) ...
</PRE>
For matrices, the form
<PRE>    for (i, j along M) ...
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>    for (j in 1..ncol(M))
        for (i in 1..nrow(M))
            ...
</PRE>
However, if <code>M</code> is of a class with its own <code>dim</code> method,
this method is not used (effectively, <code>ncol(unclass(M))</code> and
<code>nrow(unclass(m))</code> are used).  This may well change in future, 
and similarly a <code>length</code> method may in future be used when 
&ldquo;along&rdquo; is used with a vector.
</li>
<li><p> Because of the new restriction on names, the <code>make.names</code>
function will now (by default) convert a sequence of consecutive dots 
in the name it would otherwise have made to a single dot.  (See
<code>help(make.names)</code> for further details).  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For the same reason, <code>make.unique</code> has been changed so that
the separator string (which defaults to a dot) 
will not be appended to a name if the name already ends in that string.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (or mis-feature) in subsetting with a single empty
subscript, as in <code>A[]</code>.  This now works the same as if
the empty subscript had been the sequence of all indexes (ie,
like <code>A[1..length(A)]</code>), which removes all attributes except
names.
</p>
<p>R Core versions to at least R-3.3.1 instead return <code>A</code>
unchanged, preserving all attributes, though attributes are
not retained with other uses of the <code>[]</code> operator.  This
is contrary to the description in <code>help("[")</code>, and also
does not coincde with the (different) description in the R
language definition.  
</p>
<p>Returning <code>A</code> unchanged is not only inconsistent, but also
useless, since there is then no reason to ever write <code>A[]</code>.
However, internally, R Core implementions duplicate <code>A</code>,
which may be of significance when <code>A[]</code> is passed as
an argument of <code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>, <code>.Call</code>, or
<code>.External</code>, but only if the programmer is not 
abiding by the rules.  However, in pqR, the data part of a vector or
matrix is still copied when <code>A[]</code> is evaluated, so such
rule-breaking should still largely be accommodated.  A further
temporary kludge is implemented to make <code>x[,drop=FALSE]</code>
simply return a duplicate of <code>x</code>, since this (pointless)
operation is done by some packages.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs in the conversion of strings to numbers, so that the
behaviour now matches <code>help(NumericConstants)</code>, which
states that numeric constants are parsed very similarly to C99.
This was not true before (or in R-2.15.0) &ndash; some erroneous
syntax was accepted without error, and some correct syntax was
rejected, or gave the wrong value.  
</p>
<p>In particular, fractional
parts are now accepted for hexadecimal constants.  Later R Core
versions made some fixes, but up to at least R-3.3.1 there are
still problems.  For example, in R-3.3.1, 
<code>parse(text="0x1.8")[[1]]</code> gives an error, and 
<code>as.numeric("0x1.8")</code> produces 24 (as does <code>scan</code>
when given this input).  In this version of pqR, these return the
correct value of 1.5.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with identifying the version of the
makeinfo program that is installed that arises with recent versions
of makeinfo.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Put in a check for non-existent primitives when unserializing
R objects, as was done in R-3.0.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (also in R-2.15.0, but fixed in later R Core versions)
illustrated by the following code:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- array(c(3,4),dimnames=list(xyz=c("fred","bert")))
    print(a[1:2])
    print(a[])  # should print same thing, but didn't
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following code:
</p>
<PRE>    f &lt;- function (x) { try(x); missing(x) }
    g &lt;- function (y) f(y)
    h &lt;- function (z) g(z)

    f(pi[1,1])  # FALSE
    g(pi[1,1])  # FALSE
    h(pi[1,1])  # Should also be FALSE, but isn't!
</PRE>
This bug is in R Core versions to at least R-3.3.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which an internal error message is displayed
as shown below:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; f &lt;- function (...) ..1; f()
    Error in f() : 'nthcdr' needs a list to CDR down
</PRE>
A sensible error message is now produced.  This bug is also
in R Core versions to at least R-3.3.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in S4 method dispatch that caused failure
of the no-segfault test done by make check-all on Windows 10 
(pqR issue #29 + related fix).  (Also in R-2.15.0, and partially fixed
in R-3.3.0.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by
</p>
<PRE>   atan; show &lt;- function (x) cat("HI\n"); atan
</PRE>
Now, pqR no longer prints HI! for the second display of <code>atan</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug in which the result of <code>getParseData</code> omitted
the letter at the end of <code>1i</code> or <code>1L</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug in which enabling trace output from the 
helpers module and then typing control/C while trace output is
being printed could lead to pqR hanging. 
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2015-09-14</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> With this release, pqR now works on Microsoft Windows systems.
See below for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The facilities for embedding R in other applications have also
been tested in this release, and some problems with how this is
done in R Core versions have been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The parser and deparser, and the method for
performing the basic Read-Eval-Print Loop, have 
been substantially rewritten.  This has few user-visible effects
at present (apart from bug fixes and performance improvements),
but sets the stage for future improvements in pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The facility for recording detailed parsing data introduced n
R-3.0.0 has now been implemented in pqR as part of the parser
rewrite.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There are also a few other improvements and bug fixes.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Building pqR on Microsoft Windows systems, using the Rtools
facilities, has now been tested, and some problems found in 
this environment have been fixed.  Binary distributions are
not yet provided, however.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Detailed and explicit instructions for building pqR from
source on Windows systems are now provided, in the 
&lsquo;<span class="file">src/gnuwin32/INSTALL</span>&rsquo; file of the pqR source directory.
These instructions mostly correspond to information in
The R Installation and Administration manual, but in more
accessible form.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See <a href="pqR-project.org">pqR-project.org</a> for more information on Windows systems 
on which pqR has been tested, and on any problems and workarounds
that may have been discovered.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The Writing R Extensions manual now warns that on Windows,
with the Rtools toolchain, a thread started by OpenMP may have 
its floating point unit set so that long double arithmetic is 
the same as double arithmetic  Use <code>__asm__("fninit")</code> in 
C to reset the FPU so that long double arithmetic will work.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The default is now to install packages from source, since there
is no binary repository for pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>EMBEDDED R FACILITIES AND EXAMPLES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>R_ReplDLLinit</code> and <code>R_ReplDLLdo1</code> functions in
&lsquo;<span class="file">src/main/main.c</span>&rsquo; have been fixed to handle errors 
correctly, and to avoid code duplication with <code>R_ReplIteration</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Another test of embedded R has been added to &lsquo;<span class="file">tests/Embedding</span>&rsquo;,
which is the same as an example in the R Extensions manual, which
has been improved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Another example in the R Extensions manual has been changed to
mimic &lsquo;<span class="file">src/gnuwin32/embeddedR.c</span>&rsquo;.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The example in &lsquo;<span class="file">src/gnuwin32/front-ends/rtest.c</span>&rsquo; has also been 
updated.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The R Language Definition and the help files on
assignment operators (eg, <code>help("=")</code>) contained
incorrect and incomplete information on the precedence
of operators, especially the assignment operators.  
This and other incorrect information has been corrected.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The examples in <code>help(parse)</code> and <code>help(getParseData</code>
have been improved.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INTERNAL CODE REWRITES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The parser has been rewritten to use top-down recursive
descent, rather than a bottom-up parser produced by Bison
as was used previously.  This substantially simplifies
the parser, and allows several kludges in the previous
scheme to be eliminated.  Also, the rewritten parser can now
record detailed parse information (see below).
</p>
<p>The new parser for pqR is usually about a factor of 1.5 faster
than the parser in R-3.2.2, but it is sometimes enormously faster,
since the parser in R-3.2.2 will in some contexts take time growing
as the square of the length of the source file.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Much of the deparser has been rewritten.  It no longer
looks at the definitions of operators, which are irrelevant,
since the parser does not look at them.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The methods by which the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) is
done (in various contexts) have been rationalized, in
coordination with the new parsing scheme.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> In pqR-2015-07-11, the parser was changed to not include
parentheses in R language objects if they were necessary
in order for the expression to be parsed correctly.  Omitting
such parentheses improves performance.  In  this version, 
such parentheses are removed only if the <code>keep.parens</code>
option is <code>FALSE</code> (the default).  Also, parentheses
are never removed from expressions that are on the right
side of a formula, since some packages asssign significance
to such parentheses beyond their grouping function.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The right assignment operators, <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>,
are now real operators.  Previously (and in current R Core
versions), expressions involving these operators were converted
to the corresponding left assignment expressions.  This
has the potential to cause pointless confusion.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>**</code> operator, which has always been accepted as
a synonym for the <code>^</code> operator, is now recorded as
itself, rather than being converted to <code>^</code> by the
parser.  This avoids unnecessary anomalies such as the following
confusing error report:
</p>
<PRE>  &gt; a - **b
  Error: unexpected '^' in "a - **"
</PRE>
The <code>**</code> operator is defined to be the same primitive
as <code>^</code>, which is associated with the name <code>^</code>, and
hence dispatches on methods for <code>^</code> even if called via
<code>**</code>.
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES FROM LATER R CORE VERSIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: For compatibility with packages written to
be able to handle the long vectors introduced in R-3.0.0, 
definitions for <code>R_xlen_t</code>,
<code>R_XLEN_T_MAX</code>, <code>XLENGTH</code>, <code>XTRUELENGTH</code>, 
<code>SHORT_VEC_LENGTH</code>, <code>SET_SHORT_VEC_TRUELENGTH</code> are now 
provided, all the same as the corresponding regular versions (as
is also the case for R-3.0.0+ on 32-bit platforms).  The 
<code>IS_LONG_VEC</code> macro is also defined (as always false).
Note, however, that packages that declare a dependency on
R &gt;= 3.0.0 will not install even if they would in fact work
with pqR because of these compatibility definitions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: The <code>srcfile</code> argument to <code>parse()</code> may now 
be a character string, to be used in error messages.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The facilities for recording detailed parsing information
from R-3.0.0 are now implemented in pqR, as part of the
rewrite of the parser, along with the
extension to provide partial parse information when a syntax error
occurs that was introduced in R-3.0.2.  See help on <code>parse</code>
and <code>getParseData</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2: On Windows, the C stack size has been increased 
to 64MB (it has been 10MB since the days of 32MB RAM systems).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Character-at-a time input has been sped up by reducing procedure
call overhead.  This significantly speeds up <code>readLines</code>
and <code>scan</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The new parser is faster than the old parser, both because of the
parser rewrite (see above) and because of the faster character
input.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES MATCHING THOSE IN LATER R CORE VERSIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: Names containing characters which need to be escaped 
were not deparsed properly (PR#14846).  Fixed in pqR partly based
on R Core fix.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2: When given a 0-byte file and asked to keep source
references, parse() read input from stdin() instead.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3: Expressions involving user defined operators were not 
always deparsed faithfully (PR#15179).  Fixed in pqR as part of
the rewrite of the parser and deparser.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: source() did not display filenames when reporting 
syntax errors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.3: The parser now gives an error if a null character 
is included in a string using Unicode escapes. (PR#16046)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: Deparsing of infix operators with named arguments is 
improved (PR#15350). [ In fact, the change, both in pqR and in 
R Core versions, is only with respect to operators in percent 
signs, such as <code>%fred%</code>, with these now being deparsed as
function calls if either argument is named. ]
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.2.2: Rscript and command line R silently ignored incomplete
statements at the end of a script; now they are reported as parse errors
(PR#16350).  Fixed in pqR as part of the rewrite of the parser
and deparser.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.2.1: The parser could overflow internally when given 
numbers in scientific format with extremely large exponents.  
(PR#16358).  Fixed in pqR partly as in R Core fix.  Was actually a 
problem with any numerical input, not just with the parser.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.3: Extremely large exponents on zero expressed in scientific
notation (e.g. <code>0.0e50000</code>) could give <code>NaN</code> (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15976">PR#15976</a>).
Fixed as in R Core fix.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3:  On Windows, work around an event-timing problem when
the RGui console was closed from the &lsquo;X&rsquo; control and the closure
cancelled. (This would on some 64-bit systems crash <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, typically
those with a slow GPU relative to the CPU.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which a &quot;cons memory exhausted&quot; error could
be raised even though a full garbage collection that might
recover more memory had not been attempted.  (This bug appears
to be present in R Core versions as well.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The new parser fixes bugs arising from the old parser's kludge
to handle semicolons, illustrated by the incorrect output seen below:
</p>
<PRE>  &gt; p&lt;-parse()
  ?"abc;xyz"
  Error in parse() : &lt;stdin&gt;:1:1: unexpected INCOMPLETE_STRING
  1: "abc;
      ^
  &gt; p&lt;-parse()
  ?8 #abc;xyz
  Error in parse() : &lt;stdin&gt;:1:7: unexpected end of input
  1: 8 #abc;
          ^
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed deparsing of complex numbers, which were always deparsed
as the sum of a real and an imaginary part, even though the
parser can only produce complex numbers that are pure imaginary.
For example, the following output was produced before:
</p>
<PRE>  &gt; deparse(quote(3*5i))
  [1] "3 * (0+5i)"
</PRE>
This is now deparsed to <code>"3 * 5i"</code>.  This bug exists
in all R Core versions through at least R-3.2.2.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a number of bugs in the deparser that are illustrated
by the following, which produce incorrect output as noted, in
R Core versions through at least R-3.2.2:
</p>
<PRE>  deparse(parse(text="`+`(a,b)[1]")[[1]])# Omits necessary parens
  deparse(quote(`[&lt;-`(x,1)),control="S_compatible")  # unmatched " and '
  deparse(parse(text="a = b &lt;- c")[[1]]) # Puts in unnecessary parens
  deparse(parse(text="a+!b")[[1]])       # Puts in unnecessary parens
  deparse(parse(text="?lm")[[1]])        # Doesn't know about ? operator
  deparse(parse(text="a:=b")[[1]])       # Doesn't know about := operator
  deparse(parse(text="a$'x'")[[1]])      # Conflates name and character
  deparse(parse(text="`*`(2)")[[1]])     # Result is syntactically invalid
  deparse(parse(text="`$`(a,b+2)")[[1]]) # Result is syntactically invalid
  e&lt;-quote(if(x) X else Y); e[[3]]&lt;-quote(if(T)3); deparse(e)# all here 
  e &lt;- quote(f(x)); e[[2]] &lt;- quote((a=1))[[2]]; deparse(e)  # and below 
  e &lt;- quote(f(Q=x)); e[[2]] &lt;- quote((a=1))[[2]]; deparse(e)# need parens
  e &lt;- quote(while(x) 1); e[[2]] &lt;- quote((a=1))[[2]]; deparse(e)
  e &lt;- quote(if(x) 1 else 2); e[[2]] &lt;- quote((a=1))[[2]]; deparse(e)
  e &lt;- quote(for(x in y) 1); e[[3]] &lt;- quote((a=1))[[2]]; deparse(e)
</PRE>
In addition, the bug illustrated below was fixed, which was fixed
(differently) in R-3.0.0:
<PRE>  a&lt;-quote(f(1,2)); a[[1]]&lt;-function(x,y)x+y; deparse(a)  # Omits parens
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug (also in R Core versions to at least 
R-3.2.2):
</p>
<PRE> &gt; parse()
 ?'\12a\x.'
 Error: '\x' used without hex digits in character string starting "'\1a\x"
</PRE>
Note that the &quot;2&quot; has disappeared from the error message.  This
bug also affected the results of <code>getParseData</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a memory leak that can be seen by running the code below:
</p>
<PRE>  &gt; long &lt;- paste0 (c('"', rep("1234567890",820), '\x."'), collapse="")
  &gt; for (i in 1:1000000) try (e &lt;- parse(text=long), silent=TRUE)
</PRE>
The leak will not occur if 820 is changed to 810 in the above.
This bug also exists in R Core versions to at least R-3.2.2.
</li>
<li><p> Entering a string constant containing Unicode escapes that was
9999 or 10000 characters long would produce an error message saying
&quot;String is too long (max 10000 chars)&quot;.  This has been fixed
so that the maximum now really is 10000 characters.  (Also present
in R Core versions, to at least R-3.2.2.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that caused the error caret in syntax error reports
to be misplaced when more than one line of context was shown.
This was supposedly fixed in R-3.0.2, but incorrectly, resulting
in the error caret being misplaced when only one line of 
context is shown (in R Core versions to at least R-3.2.2).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> On Windows, running R.exe from a command prompt window would result in
Ctrl-C misbehaving.  This was <a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14948">PR#14948</a> at R Core, which was 
supposedly fixed in R-2.15.2, but the fix only works if a 32 or
64 bit version of R.exe is selected manually, not if the version of
R.exe that automatically runs the R.exe for a selected architecture 
is used (which is the intended normal usage).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2015-07-11</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This version is a minor modification of the version of pqR released
on 2015-06-24, which does not have a separate NEWS section, 
incorporating also the changes in the version released 2015-07-08.
These modifications fix some installation and testing 
issues that caused problems on some platforms. There are also a few
documentation and bug fixes, a few more tests, and some expansion
in the use of static boxes (see below).
Version 2015-06-24 of pqR improved reliability and portability, and
also contained some performance improvements, including some that
substantially speed up interpretive execution of programs that 
do many scalar operations.  Details are below.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The method used to quickly test for NaN/NA has changed to one that
should work universally for all current processors
(any using IEEE floating point, as already assumed in R,
with consistent endianness, as is apparently the case for 
all current general-purpose processors, and was partially
assumed before).  There is therefore no longer any reason to define
the symbol <code>ENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK</code> when compiling pqR (it
will be ignored if defined).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The module used to support parallel computation in 
helper threads has been updated to avoid a syntactic 
construction that technically violates the OpenMP 3.1 
specification.  This construction had been accepted without error
by gcc 4.8 and earlier, but is not accepted by some recent
compilers.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The tests in the version supplied of the recommended Matrix package
have been changed to not assume things that may not be true
regarding the speed and long double precision of the machine being
used.  (These tests produced spurious errors on some platforms.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The R Internals manual has been updated to better explain some
aspects of pqR implementation.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Parsed expressions no longer contain explict parenthesis
operators when the parentheses are necessary to override
the precedence of operators.  These necessary parentheses
will be inserted when the expression is deparsed.  See
the help on <code>parse</code> and <code>deparse</code>.
</p>
<p>This change does impact a few packages (such as coxme)
that consider the presence of parentheses in formulas
to be significant.  Formulas may be exempted from parenthesis
suppression in a future release, but for now, such packages
won't work.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The overhead of interpreting R code has been reduced by various
detailed code improvements, and by sometimes returning scalar
integer and real values in special &ldquo;static boxes&rdquo;.  As a result,
the benefit of using the byte-code compiler is reduced.  Note that
in pqR using the byte-code compiler can often slow down functions,
since byte-compiled code does not support some pqR optimizations
such as task merging.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Speed of evaluation for expressions with necessary parentheses will
be faster because of the feature change mentioned above that eliminates
them.  Note that including unnecessary parentheses will still 
(slightly) slow down evaluation.  (These unnecessary parentheses are 
preserved so that the expression will appear as written when deparsed.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignment to list elements, and other uses of the <code>$&lt;-</code>
operator, are now substantially faster.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Coercion of logical and integer vectors to character vectors is
now much faster, as is creation of names with sequence numbers.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Operations that create strings are now sometimes faster, due to
improvements in string hashing and memory allocation.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS FROM A LATER R CORE RELEASE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A number of performance improvements relating to S3 and S4
class implementation, due to Tomas Kalibera, were incorporated from
R 3.2.0.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A large number of fixes were made to correct reliability problems
(mostly regarding protection of pointers).  Many of these were provided
by Tomas Kalibera as fixes to R Core versions (sometimes with 
adaptation required for use in pqR).  Some were fixed in pqR
and reported to R Core.  Others were for problems only existing in pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which pqR's optimization of updates such as 
<code>a&lt;-a+1</code> could sometimes permit modification of a locked binding.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed related problems with <code>apply</code>, <code>lapply</code>, <code>vapply</code>,
and <code>eapply</code>, that can show up when the value returned by the 
function being applied is itself a function.  This problem also
resulted in incorrect display of saved warning messages.  The problems
are also fixed in R-3.2.0, in a different way.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>gctorture</code> function now works as documented, forcing
a FULL garbage collection on every allocation.  This does make
running with gctorture enabled even slower than before, when
most garbage collections were partial, but is more likely to
find problems.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>nls</code> when the <code>algorithm="port"</code>
option is used, which could result in a call of <code>nls</code>
being terminated with a spurious error message.  This bug
is most likely to arise on a 64-bit big-endian platform,
such as a 64-bit SPARC build, but will occur with small
probability on most platforms.  It is also present in R Core 
versions of R.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>readBin</code> in which a crash could occur due to
misaligned data accesses.  This bug is also present in R Core
versions of R.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIX CORRESPONDING TO ONE IN A LATER R CORE RELEASE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Removed incorrect information from <code>help(call)</code>, as also
done in R-3.0.2.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-11-16</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This and the previous release of 2014-10-23 (which does not have
a separate NEWS section) are minor updates to the 
release of 2014-09-30, with fixes for a few problems, and a few 
performance improvements.  Packages installed for pqR-2014-09-30 
or pqR-2014-10-23 do not need to be reinstalled for this release.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION, BUILDING, AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> For Mac OS X, a change has been made to allow use of the Accelerate 
framework for the BLAS in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), adapted from a patch 
by R Core.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A new test (var-lookup.R) for correctness of local vs. global symbol 
bindings has been added, which is run with other tests done by 
&quot;make check&quot;.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The documentation on &quot;contexts&quot; in the R Internals manual has
been updated to reflect a change made in pqR-2014-09-30.  (The
internals manual has also been updated to reflect changes below.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The speed of <code>for</code> loops has been improved by not bothering
to set the index variable again if it is still set to the old
value in its binding cell.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Evaluation of symbols is now a bit faster when the symbol has a 
binding in the local environment whose location is cached.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Lookup of functions now often skips local environments that
were previously found not to contain the symbol being looked up.
In particular, this speeds up calls of base functions that are
not already fast due to their being recognized as &quot;special&quot; symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The set of &quot;special&quot; symbols for which lookups in local environments
is usually particularly fast now includes <code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>,
<code>.Call</code>, <code>.External</code>, and <code>.Internal</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Adjusted a tuning parameter for <code>rowSums</code> and <code>rowMeans</code>
to be more appropriate for the cache size in modern processors.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT FROM A LATER R CORE RELEASE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The faster C implementation of diagonal matrix creation with
<code>diag</code> from R-3.0.0 has been adapted for pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a number of places in the interpreter and base packages
where objects were not properly protected agains garbage collection
(many involving use of the <code>install</code> function).  Most of
these problems are in R-2.15.0 or R-2.15.1, and probably also in 
later R Core releases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which subsetting a vector with a range created
with the colon operator that consisted entirely of invalid indexes 
could cause a crash (eg, <code>c(1,2)[10:20]</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (pqR issue #27) in which a user-defined replacement
function might get an argument that is not marked as shared, which 
could cause anomalous behaviour in some circumstances.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed an issue with passing on variant return requests to function
bodies (though it's hard to construct an example where this issue
produces incorrect results).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in initialization of user-supplied random number
generators, which occassionally showed up in package rngwell19937.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> (Actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted from NEWS.)	
Fixed problems with calls of <code>strncpy</code> that were described in
PR #15990 at r-project.org.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-09-30</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release contains several major performance improvements.  Notably,
lookup of variables will sometimes be much faster, variable updates
like <code>v &lt;- v + 1</code> will often not allocate any new space,
assignments to parts of variables (eg, <code>a[i] &lt;- 0)</code> is much faster
in the interpreter (no change for byte-compiled code), external
functions called with <code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code> now get faster
macro or inline versions of functions such as <code>CAR</code>, <code>LENGTH</code>,
and <code>REAL</code>, and calling of external functions with <code>.C</code> and 
<code>.Fortran</code> is substantially  faster, and can sometimes be done in 
a helper thread.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changes have been made to configuration options regarding use of BLAS
routines for matrix multiplication, as described below.  In part, these
changes are intended to made the default be close to what R Core 
releases do (but without the unnecessary inefficiency).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A number of updates from R Core releases after R-2.15.0 have 
been incorporated or adapted for use in pqR.  These provide some 
performance improvements, some new features or feature changes, and 
some bug fixes and documentation updates.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many other feature changes and performance improvements have also
been made, as described below, and a number of bugs have been fixed,
some of which are also present in the latest R Core release, R-3.1.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Packages using <code>.Call</code> or <code>.External</code> should be re-installed
for use with this version of pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option, which controls whether the
BLAS routines or pqR's C routines are used for matrix multiplication,
may now be set to <code>NA</code>, which is equivalent to <code>FALSE</code>,
except that for multiplication of sufficiently large matrices (not
vector-vector, vector-matrix, or matrix-vector multiplication) pqR 
will use a BLAS routine unless there is an element in one of the 
operands that is <code>NA</code> or <code>NaN</code>.  This mimics the behaviour 
of R Core implementations (at least through 3.1.1), which is motivated
by a desire to ensure that <code>NA</code> is propagated correctly even
if the BLAS does not do so, but avoids the substantial but needless 
inefficiency present in the R Core implementation.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>BLAS_in_helpers</code> option now allows run-time control of
whether BLAS routines may be done in a helper thread. (But this
will be fixed at <code>FALSE</code> if that is set as the default when
pqR is built.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>codePromises</code> option has been added to <code>deparse</code>,
and documented in <code>help(.deparseOpts)</code>.  With this option,
the deparsed expression uses the code part of a promise, not
the value, similarly to the existing <code>delayPromises</code>
option, but without the extra text that that option produces.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This new <code>codePromises</code> deparse option is now used when producing
error messages and traceback output.  This improves error messages
in the new scheme for subset assignments (see the section on
performance improvements below), and also avoids the voluminous
output previously produced in circumstances such as the following:
</p>
<PRE>   `f&lt;-` &lt;- function (x,value) x[1,1] &lt;- value
   a &lt;- 1
   f(a) &lt;- rep(123,1000)  # gives an error
   traceback()
</PRE>
This previously produced output with 1000 repetitions of 123
in the traceback produced following the error message.  The traceback
now instead shows the expression <code>rep(123,1000)</code>.
</li>
<li><p> The <code>evaluate</code> option for <code>dump</code> has been extended to
allow access to the new <code>codePromises</code> deparse option.
See <code>help(dump)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The formal arguments of primitive functions will now be returned
by <code>formals</code>, as they are shown when printed or with <code>args</code>.
In R Core releases (at least to R-3.1.1), the result of <code>formals</code>
for a primitive is <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the <code>deparse.max.lines</code> option will now limit the
number of lines printed when exiting debug of a function, as
well as when entering.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code>, arguments may be character strings
even when <code>DUP=FALSE</code> is specified - they are duplicated regardless.
This differs from R Core versions, which (at least through R-3.1.1)
give an error if an argument is a character string and <code>DUP=FALSE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code>, scalars (vectors of length one)
are duplicated (in effect, though not necessarily physically) even 
when <code>DUP=FALSE</code> is specified.  However, they are not duplicated 
in R Core versions (at least through R-3.1.1), 
so it may be unwise to rely on this.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A <code>HELPER</code> argument can now be used in <code>.C</code> and 
<code>.Fortran</code> to specify that the C or Fortran routine may
(sometimes) be done in a helper thread.  (See the section on
performance improvements below.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-3.0.2: The unary <code>+</code> operator now converts a logical vector
to an integer vector.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.0: Support for &quot;converters&quot; for use with <code>.C</code> has been 
dropped.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
<code>pmin()</code> and <code>pmax())</code> now also work when one of the inputs 
is of length zero and others are not, returning a zero-length vector,
analogously to, say, <code>+</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
.C() gains some protection against the misuse of character vector
arguments.  (An all too common error is to pass character(N),
which initializes the elements to &quot;&quot;, and then attempt to edit
the strings in-place, sometimes forgetting to terminate them.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
Calls to the new function globalVariables() in package utils
declare that functions and other objects in a package should be
treated as globally defined, so that CMD check will not note
them.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
print(packageDescription(*)) trims the Collate field by default.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: A new option &quot;show.error.locations&quot; has been added.  
When set to
TRUE, error messages will contain the location of the most recent
call containing source reference information. (Other values are
supported as well; see ?options.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
C entry points R_GetCurrentSrcref and R_GetSrcFilename have been
added to the API to allow debuggers access to the source
references on the stack.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION, BUILDING, TESTING, AND DEBUGGING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The <code>--enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS</code> configuration
option has been replaced by the ability to use a configure 
argument of <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE</code>, <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE</code>,
or <code>mat_mult_in_BLAS=NA</code>, to set the default value of this
option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers</code> configuration
option has been replaced by the ability to use a configure 
argument of <code>BLAS_in_helpers=FALSE</code> or <code>BLAS_in_helpers=TRUE</code>
to set the default value of this option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The LAPACK routines used are now the same as those in R-3.1.1 (version
3.5.0).
However, the <code>.Call</code> interface to these remains as in 
R-2.15.0 to R-2.15.3 (it was changed to use <code>.Internal</code> in R-3.0.0).
Since LAPACK 3.5.0 uses some more recent Fortran features, a 
Fortran 77 compiler such as <code>g77</code> will no longer suffice.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the environment variable <code>R_ABORT</code> to any non-null
string will prevent any attempt to produce a stack trace on a
segmentation fault, in favour of instead producing (maybe) an
immediate core dump.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The variable <code>R_BIT_BUCKET</code> in &lsquo;<span class="file">share/make/vars.mk</span>&rsquo;
now specifies a file to receive output that is normally ignored
when building pqR.  It is set to &lsquo;<span class="file">dev/null</span>&rsquo; in the distribution,
but this can be changed to help diagnose build problems.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The C functions <code>R_inspect</code> and <code>R_inspect3</code> functions are now
visible to package code, so they can be used there for debugging.
To see what they do, look in &lsquo;<span class="file">src/main/inspect.c</span>&rsquo;.  They are subject
to change, and should not appear in any code released to users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>Rf_error</code> and related procedures declared in 
&lsquo;<span class="file">R_ext/Error.h</span>&rsquo; are now if possible declared to never return,
allowing for slightly better code generation by the compiler, 
and avoiding spurious compiler warnings.  This parallels a change 
in R-3.0.1, but is more general, using the C11 noreturn facility if 
present, and otherwise resorting to the gcc facility (if gcc is used).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION FEATURES LIKE THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
install.packages(&quot;pkg_version.tgz&quot;) on Mac OS X now has sanity
checks that this is actually a binary package (as people have
tried it with incorrectly named source packages).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2: <code>--with-blas='-framework vecLib'</code> now also works
on OS X 10.8 and 10.9.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3:
Configuration and R CMD javareconf now come up with a smaller set
of library paths for Java on Oracle-format JDK (including
OpenJDK).  This helps avoid conflicts between libraries (such as
libjpeg) supplied in the JDK and system libraries.  This can
always be overridden if needed: see the 'R Installation and
Administration' manual.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.3:
The configure tests for Objective C and Objective C++ now work on
Mac OS 10.8 with Xcode 4.5.2 (PR#15107).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The cairo-based versions of <code>X11()</code> now work with
current versions of cairographics (e.g. 1.12.10).  (<a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15168">PR#15168</a>)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>


<p>These are in addition to changes in documentation relating to other
changes reported here.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Some incorrect code has been corrected in the &quot;Writing
R Extensions&quot; manual, in the &quot;Zero finding&quot;
and &quot;Calculating numerical derivatives&quot; sections.  The
discussion in &quot;Finding and Setting Variables&quot; has also been
clarified to reflect current behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Documentation in the &quot;R Internals&quot; manual has been updated
to reflect recent changes in pqR regarding symbols and variable
lookup, and to remove incorrect information about the global cache
present in the version from R-2.15.0 (and R-3.1.1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed an out-of-date comment in the section on helper threads in
the &quot;R Internals&quot; manual.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>


<p>Numerous improvements in speed and memory usage have been made in this
release of pqR.  Some of these are noted here.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Lookup of local variables is now usually much faster (especially when
the number of local variables is large), since for each symbol,
the last local binding found is now recorded, usually avoiding a 
linear search through local symbol bindings.  Those lookups that are
still needed are also now a bit faster, due to unrolling of the 
search loop.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments to selected parts of variables (eg, <code>a[i,j] &lt;- 0</code> or
<code>names(L$a[[f()]]) &lt;- v</code>) are now much faster in the interpreter.
(Such assignments within functions that are byte-compiled use a 
different mechanism that has not been changed in this release.)  
</p>
<p>This change also alters the error 
messages produced from such assignments.  They are probably not as 
informative (at least to unsophisticated users) as those that
the interpreter produced previously, though they are better than 
those produced from byte-compiled code.  On the plus side, the error 
messages are now consistent for primitive and user-written replacement 
functions, and some messages now contain short, intelligible expressions
that could previously contain huge amounts of data (see the section on 
new features above).  
</p>
<p>This change also fixes the anomaly that arguments
of subset expressions would sometimes be evaluated more than once
(eg, <code>f()</code> in the example above).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code> has been substantially
improved, partly by incorporating changes in R-2.15.1 and R-2.15.2,
but with substantial additional improvements as well.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of <code>.Call</code> and <code>.External</code> has been improved somewhat.
More importantly, the C routines called will get macro versions of 
<code>CAR</code>, <code>CDR</code>, <code>CADR</code>, etc., macro versions of <code>TYPEOF</code>
and <code>LENGTH</code>, and inline function versions of <code>INTEGER</code>,
<code>LOGICAL</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, and <code>RAW</code>.  This
avoidance of procedure call overhead for these operations may speed
up some C procedures substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> In some circumstances, a routine called with <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>
can now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other computations.
This is done only if requested with the <code>HELPER</code> option, and
at present only in certain limited circumstances, in which only a single
output variable is used.  See <code>help(.C)</code> or <code>help(.Fortran)</code>
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> As an initial use of the previous feature, the <code>findInterval</code> 
function now will sometimes execute its C routine in a helper thread.
(More significant uses of the <code>HELPER</code> option to <code>.C</code> and
<code>.Fortran</code> will follow in later releases.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments that update a local variable by applying a single unary or 
binary mathematical operation will now often re-use space for
the variable that is updated, rather than allocating new space.
For example, this will be done with all the assignments in the
second line below:
</p>
<PRE>   u &lt;- rep(1,1000); v &lt;- rep(2,1000); w &lt;- exp(2)
   u &lt;- exp(u); u &lt;- 2*u; v &lt;- v/2; u &lt;- u+v; w &lt;- w+1
</PRE>
This modification also has the effect of increasing the possibilities
for task merging.  For example, in the above code, the first two
updates for <code>u</code> will be merged into one computation that sets
<code>u</code> to <code>2*exp(u)</code> using a single loop over the vector.
</li>
<li><p> The performance of <code>rep</code> and <code>rep.int</code> is much improved.
These improvements (and improvements previously made in pqR) go beyond 
those in R Core releases from R-2.15.2 on, so these functions are often 
substantially faster in pqR than in R-2.15.2 or later R Core versions
to at least R-3.1.1, for both long and short vectors.  (However, note
that the changes in functionality made in R-2.15.2 have not been made 
in pqR; in particular, pairlists are still allowed, as in R-2.15.0.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For numeric vectors, the repetition done by <code>rep</code> and <code>rep.int</code>
may now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other computations.
For example, attaching names to the result of <code>rep</code> (if necessary)
may be done in parallel with replication of the data part.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The amount of space used on the C stack has been reduced, with the
result that deeper recursion is possible within a given C stack
limit.  For example, the following is now possible with the default
stack limit (at least on one Intel Linux system with gcc 4.6.3, results
will vary with platform):
</p>
<PRE>   f &lt;- function (n) { if (n&gt;0) 1+f(n-1) else 0 }
   options(expressions=500000)
   f(7000)
</PRE>
For comparison, with pqR-2014-06-1, and R-3.1.1, trying to evaluate 
f(3100) gives a C stack overflow error (but f(3000) works).
</li>
<li><p> Expressions now sometimes return constant values, that are shared,
and likely stored in read-only memory.  These constants include 
<code>NULL</code>, the scalars (vectors of length one) <code>FALSE</code>, 
<code>TRUE</code>, <code>NA</code>, <code>NA_real_</code>, 0.0, 1.0, 0L, 1L, ..., 10L, 
and some one-element pairlists with such constant elements.  Apart 
from <code>NULL</code>, these constants are not
<EM>always</EM> used for the corresponding value, but they often are, which
saves on memory and associated garbage collection time.  External routines
that incorrectly modify objects without checking that <code>NAMED</code> is
zero may now crash when passed a read-only constant, which is a generally
desirable debugging aid, though it might sometimes cause a package that
had previously at least sort-of worked to no longer run.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>substr</code> function has been sped up, and uses less memory,
especially when a small substring is extracted from a long string.
Assignment to <code>substr</code> has also been sped up a bit.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The function for unserializing data (eg, reading file &lsquo;<span class="file">.RData</span>&rsquo;) is
now done with elimination of tail-recursion (on the CDR field) when 
reading pairlists.  This is both faster and less likely to produce a stack
overflow.  Some other improvements to serializing/unserializing have
also been made, including support for restoring constant values (mentioned
above) as constant values.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Lookup of S3 methods has been sped up, especially when no method is
found.  This is important for several primitive functions, such as 
<code>$</code>, that look for a method when applied to an object with a class
attribute, but perform the operation themselves if no method is found.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Integer plus, minus, and times are now somewhat faster (a side effect
of switching to a more robust overflow check, as described below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Several improvements relating to garbage collection have been made.
One change is that the amount of memory used for each additional
symbol has been reduced from 112 bytes (two CONS cells) to 80 bytes
(on 64-bit platforms), not counting the space for the symbol's name
(a minumum of 48 bytes on 64-bit platforms).  Another change is in 
tuning of heap sizes, in order to reduce occasions in which garbage 
collection is very frequent.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many uses of the <code>return</code> statement have been sped up.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Functions in the <code>apply</code> family have been sped up when they are
called with no additional arguments for the function being applied.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The performance problem reported in PR #15798 at r-project.org has
been fixed (differently from the R Core fix).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A performance bug has been fixed in which any assignment to a vector 
subscripted with a string index caused the entire vector to be copied.
For example, the final assignment in the code below would copy all
of <code>a</code>:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-rep(1.1,10000); names(a)[1] &lt;- "x"
   a["x"] &lt;- 9
</PRE>
This bug exists in R Core implementations though at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> A performance bug has been fixed that involved subscripting with many 
invalid string indexes, reported on r-devel on 2010-07-15 and 
2013-05-8.  It is illustrated by the following code, 
which was more than ten thousand times slower than expected:
</p>
<PRE>   x &lt;- c(A=10L, B=20L, C=30L)
   subscript &lt;- c(LETTERS[1:3], sprintf("ID%05d", 1:150000))
   system.time(y1 &lt;- x[subscript])
</PRE>
The fix in this version of pqR does not solve the related problem 
when assigning to <code>x[subscript]</code>, which is still slow.  Fixing
that would require implementation of a new method, possibly requiring
more memory.
This performance bug exists in R Core releases through R-3.1.1, but
may now be fixed (differently) in the current R Core development version.
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>numericDeriv</code> (see also the documentation
update above), which is illustrated by the following
code, which gave the wrong derivative:
</p>
<PRE>    x &lt;- y &lt;- 10
    numericDeriv(quote(x+y),c("x","y"))
</PRE>
I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed (differently) in
R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem in <code>.C</code> and <code>.Fortran</code> where, contrary
to the documentation (except when <code>DUP=TRUE</code> and no duplication 
was actually needed), logical values after the call other than 
<code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, and <code>NA</code> are not mapped to <code>TRUE</code>,
but instead exist as invalid values that may show up later.
This bug exists in R Core versions 2.15.1 through at least 3.1.1.
I reported it as <a href="https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15878">PR#15878</a> at r-project.org, so it may be fixed in
a later R Core release.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with treatment of <code>ANYSXP</code> in specifying
types of registered C or Fortran routines, which in particular had
prevented the types of <code>str_signif</code>, used in <code>formatC</code>,
from being registered.  (This bug exists in R Core versions of R
at least through R-3.1.1.) 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>substr</code> applied to a string with UTF-8
encoding, which could cause a crash for code such as
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- "\xc3\xa9"
   Encoding(a) &lt;- "UTF-8"
   b &lt;- paste0(rep(a,8000),collapse="")
   c &lt;- substr(b,1,16000)
</PRE>
I reported this as PR15910 at r-project.org, so it may be
fixed in an R Core release after R-3.1.1.  A related bug in
assignment to <code>substr</code> has also been fixed.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in how debugging is handled that is illustrated by the
following output:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; g &lt;- function () { A &lt;&lt;- A+1; function (x) x+1 }
   &gt; f &lt;- function () (g())(10)
   &gt; A &lt;- 0; f(); print(A)
   [1] 11
   [1] 1
   &gt; debug(f);
   &gt; A &lt;- 0; f(); print(A)
   debugging in: f()
   debug: (g())(10)
   Browse[2]&gt; c
   exiting from: f()
   [1] 11
   [1] 2
</PRE>
Note that the final value of <code>A</code> is different (and wrong) when
<code>f</code> is stepped through in the debugger.  This bug exists in
R Core releases through at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following code, which gave
an error saying that <code>p[1,1]</code> has the wrong number of subscripts:
</p>
<PRE>   p &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3,4); dim(p) &lt;- c(2,2); p[1,1] &lt;- 9
</PRE>
This bug exists in R Core releases through at least R-3.1.1.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following pqR bug (and related bugs), in which
<code>b</code> was modified by the assignment to <code>a</code>:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(list(1+1))
   b &lt;- a
   attr(a[[1]][[1]],"fred")&lt;-9
   print(b)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug in which <code>b</code> was modified
by an assignment to <code>a</code> with a vector subscript:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(list(mk2(1)))
   b &lt;- a[[1]]
   a[[c(1,1)]][1] &lt;- 3
   print(b)
</PRE>
This bug also exists in R-2.15.0, but was fixed in R-3.1.1 
(quite differently than in pqR).
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of error checking bug that could cause expressions
such as <code>match.call(,expression())</code> to crash from an
invalid memory reference.  This bug also exists in R-2.15.0 and
R-3.1.1.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the non-robust checks for integer overflow, which reportedly
sometimes fail when using clang on a Mac.  This is #PR 15774 at
r-project.org, fixed in R-3.1.1, but fixed differently in pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a pqR bug with expressions of the form <code>t(x)%*%y</code>
when <code>y</code> is an S4 object.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (PR #15399 at r-project.og) in <code>na.omit</code> and 
<code>na.exclude</code> that led to a
data frame that should have had zero rows having one row instead.
(Also fixed in R-3.1.1, though differently.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the problem that RStudio crashed whenever a function was
debugged (with <code>debug</code>).  This was due to pqR having changed
the order of fields in the <code>RCNTXT</code> structure, which is an
internal data structure of the interpreter, but is nevertheless
accessed in RStudio.  The order of fields is now back to what it was.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the bug in <code>nlm</code> reported as PR #15958
at r-project.org, along with related bugs in <code>uniroot</code> and
<code>optimize</code>.  These all involve situations where the function
being optimized saves its argument in some manner, and then sees
the saved value change when the optimizer re-uses the space for the 
argument on the next call.  The fix made is to no longer reuse the 
space, which will unfortunately cause a (fairly small) decline in 
performance.
</p>
<p>The <code>optim</code> function also has this problem, but only
when numerical derivatives are used.  It has not yet been fixed.
The <code>integrate</code> function does not seem to have a problem.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in the code to check for C stack overflow, that may
show up when the fallback method for determining the start of the
stack is needed, and a stack check is then done when very little stack
is in use, resulting in an erroneous report of stack overflow.  The
problem is platform dependent, but arises on a SPARC Solaris system 
when using gcc 3.4.3, once stack usage is reduced by the improvement
described above, leading to failure of one of the tests for package 
Matrix.  This bug exists in R Core version back to 2.11.1 (or earlier)
and up to at least 3.1.1.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: 
Trying to update (recommended) packages in R_HOME/library without
write access is now dealt with more gracefully.  Further, such
package updates may be skipped (with a warning), when a newer
installed version is already going to be used from .libPaths().
(PR#14866)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
<CODE>R CMD check</CODE> with <span class="env">_R_CHECK_NO_RECOMMENDED_</span>
set to a true value (as done by the <CODE>--as-cran</CODE> option)
could issue false errors if there was an indirect dependency
on a recommended package.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
getMethod(f, sig) produced an incorrect error message in some
cases when f was not a string).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2:
In Windows, the GUI preferences for foreground color were 
not always respected.  (Reported by Benjamin Wells.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The evaluator now keeps track of source references outside of
functions, e.g. when source() executes a script.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1:
The value returned by tools::psnice() for invalid pid values was
not always NA as documented.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.2:
<code>sort.list(method = "radix")</code> could give incorrect
results on certain compilers (seen with <CODE>clang</CODE> on Mac OS
10.7 and <CODE>Xcode 4.4.1</CODE>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1:
Calling <code>file.copy()</code> or <code>dirname()</code> with the
invalid input <code>""</code> (which was being used in packages, despite
not being a file path) could have caused a segfault.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1:
<code>dirname("")</code> is now <code>""</code> rather than <code>"."</code> (unless
it segfaulted).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Similarly to R-3.1.1-patched:
In package <code>parallel</code>, child processes now call <code>_Exit</code>
rather than <code>exit</code>, so that the main process is not affected
by flushing of input/output buffers in the child.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-06-19</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, documentation
improvements (including provision of previously missing
documentation), and changes for compatibility with R Core releases.
There are some new features in this release that help
with testing pqR and packages. There are no significant changes 
in performance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the sections below on earlier releases for general
information on pqR.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that there was a test release of 2014-06-10 that 
is superceded by this release, with no separate listing 
of the changes it contained.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>NEW FEATURES FOR TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The setting of the <code>R_SEED</code> environment variable now specifies what
random number seed to use when <code>set.seed</code> is not called.  When
<code>R_SEED</code> is not set, the seed will be set from the time and process
ID as before.  It is recommended that <code>R_SEED</code> be set before running
tests on pqR or packages, so that the results will be reproducible.
For example, some packages report an error if a hypothesis test on
simulated data results in a p-value less than some threshold.  If 
<code>R_SEED</code> is not set, these packages will fail their tests now 
and then at random, whereas setting <code>R_SEED</code> will result either
in consistent success or (less likely) consistent failure.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The comparison of test output with saved output using <code>Rdiff</code> now
ignores any output from <code>valgrind</code>, so spurious errors will not be
triggered by using it.  When using <code>valgrind</code>, the
output files should be checked manually for <code>valgrind</code> messages 
that are of possible interest.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The test script in &lsquo;<span class="file">tests/internet.R</span>&rsquo; no longer looks at CRAN's html
code, which is subject to change.  It instead looks at a special test file
at <a href="pqR-project.org">pqR-project.org</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed problems wit the &lsquo;<span class="file">reg-tests-1b</span>&rsquo; test script.  Also, now sets
the random seed, so it's consistent (even without R_SEED set), and has
its output compared to a saved version.  Non-fatal errors (with
code 5) should be expected on systems without enough memory for xz
compression.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>CHANGE FOR COMPATIBILITY</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The result of <code>diag(list(1,3,5))</code> is now a matrix of type
double.  In R-2.15.0, this expression did not produce a sensible
result.  A previous fix in pqR made this expression produce a matrix of 
type list.  A later change by R Core also fixed this, but so it
produced a double matrix, coercing the list to a numeric vector
(to the extent possible); pqR now does the same.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The documentation for <code>c</code> now says how the names for the 
result are determined, including previously missing information
on the <code>use.names</code> argument, and on the role of the names of
arguments in the call of <code>c</code>.  This documentation is missing
in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentaton for <code>diag</code> now documents that a diagonal matrix 
is always created with type double or complex, and that the
names of an extracted diagonal vector are taken from a <code>names</code>
attribute (if present), if not from the row and column names.  This
information is absent in the documentation in R-2.15.1 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Incorrect information regarding the pointer protection stack
was removed from <code>help(Memory)</code>.  This incorrect information
is present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0 as well.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> There is now information in <code>help(Arithmetic)</code> regarding what
happens when the operands of an arithmetic operation are <code>NA</code>
or <code>NaN</code>, including the arbitrary nature of the result when
one operand is <code>NA</code> and the other is <code>NaN</code>.  There is
no discussion of this issue in the documentation for R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>R_HELPERS</code> and <code>R_HELPERS_TRACE</code> environment variables
are now documented in <code>help("environment variables")</code>.  The
documentation in <code>help(helpers)</code> has also been clarified.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>R_DEBUGGER</code> and <code>R_DEBUGGER_ARGS</code> environment variables
are now documented in <code>help("environment variables")</code> as 
alternatives to the <code>--debugger</code> and <code>--debugger-args</code>
arguments.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed lack of protection bugs in the <code>equal</code> and <code>greater</code>
functions in &lsquo;<span class="file">sort.c</span>&rsquo;.  These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0
and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed lack of protection bugs in the <code>D</code> function in &lsquo;<span class="file">deriv.c</span>&rsquo;.
These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed argument error-checking bugs in <code>getGraphicsEventEnv</code>
and <code>setGraphicsEventEnv</code> (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a stack imbalance bug that shows up in the expression
<code>anyDuplicated(c(1,2,1),incomp=2)</code>.  This bug is also present
in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.  The bug is reported only when the <code>base</code>
package is not byte compiled (but still exists silently when it is 
compiled).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in the foreign package that showed up on systems where
the C <code>char</code> type is unsigned, such as a Rasberry Pi running
Rasbian.  I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed in R-3.1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of protection bug that arose when <code>log</code> produced a
warning.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack of protection bug in the <code>lang[23456]</code>
C functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a stack imbalance bug that showed up when an assignment was
made to an array of three or more dimensions using a zero-length
subscript.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with <code>news()</code> that was due to pqR's version
numbers being dates (pqR issue #1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed out-of-bound memory accesses in <code>R_chull</code> and <code>scanFrame</code>
that valgrind reports (but which are likely to be innocuous).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The string &quot;infinity&quot; now converts correctly to <code>Inf</code>
(PR#14933).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The generic for backsolve is now correct (PR#14883).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: A bug in <code>get_all_vars</code> was fixed (PR#14847).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: Fixed an argument error checking bug in <code>dev.set</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.1.0-patched: Fixed a problem with <code>mcmapply</code> not 
parallelizing when the number of jobs was less than number of cores.
(However, unlike R-3.1.0-patched, this fix doesn't try to 
parallelize when there is only one core.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-02-23</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, changes for
compatibility with packages, additional correctness tests, and 
documentation improvements.  There are no new features in this 
release, and no significant changes in performance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the sections below on earlier releases for general
information on pqR.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The information in the file &quot;INSTALL&quot; in the main source directory 
has been re-written.  It now contains all the information expected
to be needed for most installations, without the user needing to
refer to R-admin, including information on the configuration
options that have been added for pqR.  It also has information on
how to build pqR from a development version downloaded from github.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Additional tests regarding subsetting operations, maintenance of
NAMEDCNT, and operation of helper threads have been written.
They are run with <code>make check</code> or <code>make check-all</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A &quot;create-configure&quot; shell script is now included, which allows
for creation of the &quot;configure&quot; shell script when it is non-functional
or not present (as when building from a development version of pqR).
It is not needed for typical installs of pqR releases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some problems with installation on Microsoft Windows (identified
by Yu Gong) have hopefully been fixed.  (But trying to install
pqR on Windows is still recommended only for adventurous users.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A problem with installing pqR as a shared library when multithreading
is disabled has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus 
C or Fortran routines called by <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>) that
were compiled and installed under R Core versions of R must be 
re-installed for use with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions
of R (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 or pqR-2013-12-29 with this 
release, because the formats of the crucial internal data structures 
happen not to have changed).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>DOCUMENTATION UPDATES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The instructions in &quot;INSTALL&quot; have been re-written, as noted above.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The manual on &quot;Writing R Extensions&quot; now has additional information 
(in the section on &quot;Named objects and copying&quot;) on paying proper attention
to NAMED for objects found in lists.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> More instructions on how to create a release branch of pqR from a 
development branch have been added to mods/README (or MODS).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>CHANGES REGARDING PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY AND CHECKING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Changed the behaviour of <code>$</code> when dispatching so that the unevaluated
element name arrives as a string, as in R-2.15.0.  This behaviour is
needed for the &quot;dyn&quot; package.  The issue is illustrated by the
following code:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- list(p=3,q=4)
    class(a) &lt;- "fred"
    `$.fred` &lt;-
      function (x,n) { print(list(n,substitute(n))); x[[n]] }
    print(a$q)
</PRE>
In R-2.15.0, both elements of the list printed are strings, but in
pqR-2013-12-29, the element from &quot;substitute&quot; is a symbol.  Changed
<code>help("$")</code> to document this behaviour, and the corresponding 
behaviour of <code>"$&lt;-"</code>.  Added a test with <code>make check</code> for it.
</li>
<li><p> Redefined &quot;fork&quot; to &quot;Rf_fork&quot; so that helper threads can be disabled
in the child when &quot;fork&quot; is used in packages like &quot;multicore&quot;. 
(Special mods for this had previously been made to the &quot;parallel&quot; 
package, but this is a more universal scheme.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added an option (currently set) for pqR to ignore incorrect zero
pointers encountered by the garbage collector (as R-2.15.0 does).
This avoids crashes with some packages (eg, &quot;birch&quot;) that incorrectly
set up objects with zero pointers.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed a C procedure name in the &quot;matprod&quot; routines to reduce the
chance of a name conflict with C code in packages.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Made <code>NA_LOGICAL</code> and <code>NA_INTEGER</code> appear as variables
(rather than constants) in packages, as needed for package
&quot;RcppEigen&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Made <code>R_CStackStart</code> and <code>R_CStackLimit</code> visible to 
packages, as needed for package &quot;vimcom&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed problem with using <code>NAMED</code> in a package that defines
<code>USE_RINTERNALS</code>, such as &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Calls of external routines with .Call and .External are now
followed by checks that the routine didn't incorrectly change 
the constant objects sometimes used internally in pqR for TRUE, 
FALSE, and NA.  (Previously, such checks were made only after calls 
of .C and .Fortran.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
</p>
<PRE>    x &lt;- t(5)
    print (x %*% c(3,4))
    print (crossprod(5,c(3,4)))
</PRE>
The call of <code>crossprod</code> produced an error, whereas the corresponding
use of <code>%*%</code> does not.
In pqR-2013-12-29, this bug also affected the expression 
<code>t(5) %*% c(3,4)</code>, since it is converted to the equivalent of 
<code>crossprod(5,c(3,4))</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem in R_AllocStringBuffer that could result in
a crash due to an invalid memory access.  (This bug is also
present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in a &quot;matprod&quot; routine sometimes affecting 
<code>tcrossprod</code> (or an equivalent use of <code>%*%</code>) with 
helper threads.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    f &lt;- function (a)
    { x &lt;- a
      function () { b &lt;- a; b[2]&lt;-1000; a+b  }
    }
    g &lt;- f(c(7,8,9))
    save.image("tmpimage")
    load("tmpimage")
    print(g())
</PRE>
where the result printed was 14 2000 18 rather than 14 1008 18.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>prod</code> with an integer vector containing <code>NA</code>, 
such as, <code>prod(NA)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a lack-of-protection bug in mkCharLenCE that showed up
in checks for packages &quot;cmrutils&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a problem with xtfrm demonstrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>    f&lt;-function(...) xtfrm(...); f(c(1,3,2))
</PRE>
which produced an error saying '...' was used in an incorrect context.
This affected package &quot;lsr&quot;. 
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in maintaining NAMEDCNT when assigning to a variable in
an environment using <code>$</code>, which showed up in package &quot;plus&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that causes the code below to create a circular data 
structure:
</p>
<PRE>    { a &lt;- list(1); a[[1]] &lt;- a; a }
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs such as that illustrated below:
</p>
<PRE>    a &lt;- list(list(list(1)))
    b &lt;- a
    a[[1]][[1]][[1]]&lt;-2
    print(b)
</PRE>
in which the assignment to <code>a</code> changes <code>b</code>, and added tests
for such bugs.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where unary minus might improperly reuse its operand for
the result even when it was logical (eg, in <code>-c(F,T,T,F)</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in pairlist element deletion, and added tests in subset.R
for such cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The ISNAN trick (if enabled) is now used only in the interpreter itself,
not in packages, since the macro implementing it evaluates its argument
twice, which doesn't work if it has side effects (as happens in the 
&quot;ff&quot; package).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in task merging being disabled
when it shouldn't have been.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-12-29</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This is the first publicized release of pqR after pqR-2013-07-22.  
A verson dated 2013-11-28 was released for testing; it differs
from this release only in bug and documentation fixes, which
are not separately detailed in this NEWS file.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by
implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See the notes
below on earlier pqR releases for general discussion of pqR, and for
information that has not changed from previous releases of pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The most notable change in this release is that &ldquo;task merging&rdquo;
is now implemented.  This can speed up sequences
of vector operations by merging several operations into one, which 
reduces time spent writing and later reading data in memory. 
See <code>help(merging)</code> and the item below for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release also includes other performance improvements, bug fixes,
and code cleanups, as detailed below.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Additional configuration options are now present to allow
enabling and disabling of task merging, and more generally, of the
deferred evaluation framework needed for both task merging and
use of helper threads.  By default, these facilities are enabled.
The <code>--disable-task-merging</code> option to <code>./configure</code>
disables task merging, <code>--disable-helper-threads</code> disables
support for helper threads (as before), and 
<code>--disable-deferred-evaluation</code> disables both of these
features, along with the whole deferred evaluation framework.
See the <code>R-admin</code> manual for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See the pqR wiki at <code>https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki</code>
for the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
work with pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus 
C or Fortran routines called by <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code>) that
were compiled and installed under R Core versions of R must be 
re-installed for use with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions
of R (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 with this release, because the 
formats of the crucial internal data structures happen not to have
changed).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Additional tests of matrix multiplication (<code>%*%</code>, <code>crossprod</code>,
and <code>tcrossprod</code>) have been written.  They are run with
<code>make check</code> or <code>make check-all</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The table of built-in function names, C functions implementing them, and
operation flags, which was previously found in <code>src/main/names.c</code>,
has been split into multiple tables, located in the source files that 
define such built-in functions (with only a few entries still in 
<code>names.c</code>).  This puts the descriptions of these built-in
functions next to their definitions, improving maintainability, and
also reduces the number of global functions.  This change should have 
no effects visible to users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The initialization for fast dispatch to some primitive functions
is now done in <code>names.c</code>, using tables in other source files
analogous to those described in the point just above.  This is 
cleaner, and eliminates an anomaly in the previous versions of
pqR that a primitive function could be slower the first time it was
used than when used later.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Some sequences of vector operations can now be merged into a single
operation, which can speed them up by eliminating memory operations
to store and fetch intermediate results.  For example, when <code>v</code> is 
a long vector, the expression 
<code>exp(v+1)</code> can be merged into one task, which will compute 
<code>exp(v[i]+1)</code> for each element, <code>i</code>, of <code>v</code> in a 
single loop.  
</p>
<p>Currently, such &ldquo;task merging&rdquo; is done only for (some)
operations in which only one operand is a vector. When there are
helper threads (which might be able to do some operations even
faster, in parallel) merging is done only when one of the
operations merged is a simple addition, subtraction, or
multiplication (with one vector operand and one scalar operand).
</p>
<p>See <code>help(merging)</code> for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> During all garbage collections, any tasks whose outputs are not
referenced are now waited for, to allow memory used by their outputs to be
recovered.  (Such unreferenced outputs should be rare in real 
programs.)  In a full garbage collection, tasks with large inputs
or outputs that are referenced only as task inputs
are also waited for, so that the memory they occupy can be recovered.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The built-in C matrix multiplication routines and those in the supplied 
BLAS have both been sped up, especially those used by <code>crossprod</code>
and <code>tcrossprod</code>.  This will of course have no effect if a different
BLAS is used and the <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option is set to
<code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Matrix multiplications in which one operand can be recognized as the
result of a transpose operation are now done without actually creating
the transpose as an intermediate result, thereby reducing both 
computation time and memory usage.  Effectively, these uses of the
<code>%*%</code> operator are converted to uses of <code>crossprod</code> or
<code>tcrossprod</code>.  See <code>help("%*%")</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Speed of <code>ifelse</code> has been improved (though it's now slower when the
condition is scalar due to the bug fix mentioned below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Inputs to the mod operator can now be piped. (Previously, this was 
inadvertently prevented in some cases.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of the quick check for NA/NaN that can be enabled with 
<code>-DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK</code> in CFLAGS has been improved.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>ifelse</code> with scalar condition but other
operands with length greater than one.  (Pointed out by Luke Tierney.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug stemming from re-use of operand storage for a result
(pointed out by Luke Tierney) illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   A &lt;- array(c(1), dim = c(1,1), dimnames = list("a", 1))
   x &lt;- c(a=1)
   A/(pi*x)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers</code> configuration
setting is now respected for complex matrix multiplication
(previously it had only disabled use of the BLAS in helper
threads for real matrix multiplication).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation for <code>aperm</code> now says that the default
method does not copy attributes (other than dimensions and
dimnames).  Previously, it incorrecty said it did (as is the
case also in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed <code>apply</code> from previous versions of pqR to replicate
the behaviour seen in R-2.15.0 (and later R Core version) when the matrix 
or array has a class attribute.  Documented this behaviour (which is
somewhat dubious and convoluted) in the help entry for <code>apply</code>.
This change fixes a problem seen in package TSA (and probably others).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Changed <code>rank</code> from prevous versions of pqR to replicate
the behaviour when it is applied to data frames that is seen in R-2.15.0 
(and later R Core versions).  Documented this (somewhat dubious) 
behaviour in the help entry for <code>rank</code>.  This change fixes a
problem in the <code>coin</code> package.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in keeping track of references when assigning 
repeated elements into a list array.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
</p>
<PRE>   v &lt;- c(1,2)
   m &lt;- matrix(c(3,4),1,2)
   print(t(m)%*%v)
   print(crossprod(m,v))
</PRE>
in which <code>crossprod</code> gave an error rather than produce the answer
for the corresponding use of <code>%*%</code>.
</li>
<li><p> Bypassed a problem with the Xcode gcc compiler for the Mac that 
led to it falsely saying that using -DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in CFLAGS
doesn't work.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-07-22</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by
implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See the notes
below, on the release of 2013-06-28, for general discussion of pqR,
and for information on pqR that has not changed since that release.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This updated release of pqR provides some performance
enhancements and bug fixes, including some from R Core releases after
R-2.15.0.  More work is still needed to incorporate improvements in
R-2.15.1 and later R Core releases into pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release is the same as the briefly-released version of
2013-17-19, except that it fixes one bug and one reversion of an
optimization that were introduced in that release, and tweaks the
Windows Makefiles (which are not yet fully tested).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE AND DOCUMENTATION CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Detailed information on what operations can be done in helper
threads is now provided by help(helpers).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignment to parts of a vector via code such as 
<code>v[[i]]&lt;-value</code> and <code>v[ix]&lt;-values</code> now automatically 
converts raw values to the appropriate type
for assignment into numeric or string vectors, and assignment
of numeric or string values into a raw vector now results in the
raw vector being first converted to the corresponding type.  This
is consistent with the existing behaviour with other types.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The allowed values for assignment to an element of an &quot;expression&quot; 
list has been expanded to match the allowed values for ordinary
lists.  These values (such as function closures) could previously 
occur in expression lists as a result of other operations (such
as creation with the <code>expression</code> primitive).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Operations such as
<code>v &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3); v[[-2]] &lt;- NULL</code> now raise an error.
These operations were previously documented as being illegal, and
they are illegal for ordinary lists.  The proper way to do
this deletion is <code>v &lt;- pairlist(1,2,3); v[-2] &lt;- NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Raising <code>-Inf</code> to a large value (eg, <code>(-Inf)^(1e16)</code>)
no longer produces an incomprehensible warning.  As before, the 
value returned is <code>Inf</code>, because (due to their 
limited-precision floating-point representation) all such large 
numbers are even integers.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: On Windows, there are two new environment variables which
control the defaults for command-line options.
</p>
<p>If <span class="env">R_WIN_INTERNET2</span> is set to a non-empty value, it is as if
<span class="option">--internet2</span> was used.
</p>
<p>If <span class="env">R_MAX_MEM_SIZE</span> is set, it gives the default memory limit
if <span class="option">--max-mem-size</span> is not specified: invalid values being
ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: The NA warning messages from e.g. <code>pchisq()</code> now 
report the call to the closure and not that of the <code>.Internal</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The following included software has been updated to new versions:
zlib to 1.2.8, LZMA to 5.0.4, and PCRE to 8.33.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> See the pqR wiki at <code>https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki</code>
for the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
work with pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that any previosly-installed packages must be re-installed for 
use with pqR (as is generally the case with new versions of R), except
for those written purely in R.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is now known that pqR can be successfully installed under Mac
OS X for use via the command line (at least with some versions
of OS X).  The gcc 4.2
compiler supplied by Apple with Xcode works when helper threads
are disabled, but does not have the full OpenMP support required for
helper threads.   For helper threads to work, a C compiler that fully
supports OpenMP is needed, such as gcc 4.7.3 (available via 
macports.org).
</p>
<p>The Apple BLAS and LAPACK routines can be used by giving the
<code>--with-blas='-framework vecLib'</code> and <code>--withlapack</code>
options to <code>configure</code>.  This speeds up some operations
but slows down others.
</p>
<p>The R Mac GUI would need to be recompiled for use with pqR.
There are problems doing this unless helper threads
are disabled (see pqR issue #17 for discussion).
</p>
<p>Compiled binary versions of pqR for Mac OS X are not yet being supplied.
Installation on a Mac is recommended only for users experienced
in installation of R from source code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Success has also been reported in installing pqR on a Windows
system, including with helper threads, but various tweaks were
required.  Some of these tweaks are incorporated in this release,
but they are probably not sufficient for installation &quot;out of the box&quot;.
Attempting to install pqR on Windows is recommended only for
users who are both experienced and adventurous.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Compilation using the <code>-O3</code> option for gcc is not recommended.
It speeds up some operations, but slows down others.  With gcc 4.7.3
on a 32-bit Intel system running Ubuntu 13.04, compiling with 
<code>-O3</code> causes compiled functions to crash. (This is not a
pqR issue, since the same thing happens when R-2.15.0 is compiled 
with <code>-O3</code>).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The R internals manual now documents (in Section 1.8) a
preliminary set of conventions that pqR follows (not yet
perfectly) regarding when objects may be modified, and how
NAMEDCNT should be maintained.  R-2.15.0 did not follow any
clear conventions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation in the R internals manual on how helper
threads are implemented in pqR now has the correct title.  (It
would previously have been rather hard to notice.)
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Some unnecessary duplication of objects has been eliminated.  Here
are three examples:  
Creation of lists no longer duplicates all the elements put in the
list, but instead increments <code>NAMEDCNT</code> for these elements, so
that
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- numeric(10000)
   k &lt;- list(1,a)
</PRE>
no longer duplicates <code>a</code> when <code>k</code> is created (though a duplication
will be needed later if either <code>a</code> or <code>k[[2]]</code> is modified).
Furthermore, the assignment below to <code>b$x</code>, no longer
causes duplication of the 10000 elements of <code>y</code>:
<PRE>   a &lt;- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
   b &lt;- a
   b$x &lt;- 2
</PRE>
Instead, a single vector of 10000 elements is shared between <code>a$y</code> and
<code>b$y</code>, and will be duplicated later only if necessary.  Unnecessary
duplication of a 10000-element vector is also avoided when <code>b[1]</code> is 
assigned to in the code below:
<PRE>   a &lt;- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
   b &lt;- a$y
   a$y &lt;- 0
   b[1] &lt;- 1
</PRE>
The assignment to <code>a$y</code> now reduces <code>NAMEDCNT</code> for the vector
bound to <code>b</code>, allowing it to be changed without duplication.
</li>
<li><p> Assignment to part of a vector using code such as <code>v[101:200]&lt;-0</code>
will now not actually create a vector of 100 indexes, but will instead
simply change the elements with indexes 101 to 200 without creating
an index vector.  This optimization has not yet been implemented for
matrix or array indexing.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Assignments to parts of vectors, matrices, and arrays using &quot;[&quot; has been
sped up by detailed code improvements, quite substantially in some
cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Subsetting of arrays of three or more dimensions using &quot;[&quot; has
been sped up by detailed code improvements.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Pending summations of one-argument mathematical functions are now
passed on by <code>sum</code>.  So, for example, in 
<code>sum(exp(a)) + sum(exp(b))</code>, the two
summations of exponentials can now potentially be done in parallel.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A full garbage collection now does not wait for all tasks being
done by helpers to complete.  Instead, only tasks that are using
or computing variables that are not otherwise referenced are 
waited for (so that this storage can be reclaimed).
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A bug that could have affected the result of <code>sum(abs(v))</code> when
it is done by a helper thread has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A bug that could have allowed <code>as.vector</code>, <code>as.integer</code>, etc.
to pass on an object still being computed to a caller not expecting
such a pending object has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some bugs in which production of warnings at inopportune times could 
have caused serious problems have been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The bug illustrated below (pqR issue #13) has been fixed:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; l = list(list(list(1)))
   &gt; l1 = l[[1]]
   &gt; l[[c(1,1,1)]] &lt;- 2
   &gt; l1
   [[1]]
   [[1]][[1]]
   [1] 2
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) illustrated by the
following code:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; a &lt;- list(x=c(1,2),y=c(3,4))
   &gt; b &lt;- as.pairlist(a)
   &gt; b$x[1] &lt;- 9
   &gt; print(a)
   $x
   [1] 9 2
   
   $y
   [1] 3 4
</PRE>
The value printed for a has a$x[1] changed to 9, when it should still be 1.
See pqR issue #14.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) in which extending
an &quot;expression&quot; by assigning to a new element changes it to an ordinary
list.  See pqR issue #15.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed several bugs (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) illustrated
by the code below (see pqR issue #16):
</p>
<PRE>   v &lt;- c(10,20,30)
   v[[2]] &lt;- NULL        # wrong error message
   
   x &lt;- pairlist(list(1,2))
   x[[c(1,2)]] &lt;- NULL   # wrongly gives an error, referring to misuse
                         # of the internal SET_VECTOR_ELT procedure
   
   v&lt;-list(1)
   v[[quote(abc)]] &lt;- 2  # internal error, this time for SET_STRING_ELT
   
   a &lt;- pairlist(10,20,30,40,50,60)
   dim(a) &lt;- c(2,3)
   dimnames(a) &lt;- list(c("a","b"),c("x","y","z"))
   print(a)              # doesn't print names
   
   a[["a","x"]] &lt;- 0     # crashes with a segmentation fault
</PRE>
</li></ul>



<h4>BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>formatC()</code> uses the C entry point <code>str_signif</code>
which could write beyond the length allocated for the output string.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE)</code> no longer
underflows early for large x (e.g. 800).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: <code>?Arithmetic</code>'s &ldquo;<code>1 ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ 0</code>
are <code>1</code>, <EM>always</EM>&rdquo; now also applies for <code>integer</code>
vectors <code>y</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-2.15.1: X11-based pixmap devices like <code>png(type = "Xlib")</code> 
were trying to set the cursor style, which triggered some warnings and
hangs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> From R-3.0.1 patched: Fixed comment-out bug in BLAS, as per PR 14964.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-06-28</h3>




<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


 
<ul>
<li><p> This release of pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R
Core Team, but improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it
up, but also by implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.
One notable speed improvement in pqR is that for systems with multiple
processors or processor cores, pqR is able to do some numeric
computations in parallel with other operations of the interpreter, and
with other numeric computations.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This is the second publicised release of pqR (the first was on
2013-06-20, and there were earlier unpublicised releases). It fixes one
significant pqR bug (that could cause two empty strings to not compare
as equal, reported by Jon Clayden), fixes a bug reported to R Core (PR
15363) that also existed in pqR (see below), fixes a bug in deciding
when matrix multiplies are best done in a helper thread, and fixes some
issues preventing pqR from being built in some situations (including
some partial fixes for Windows suggested by &quot;armgong&quot;).  Since the
rest of the news is almost unchanged from the previous release, I have
not made a separate news section for this release. (New sections will
be created once new releases have significant differences.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This section documents changes in pqR from R-2.15.0 that are of
direct interest to users.  For changes from earlier version of R to
R-2.15.0, see the ONEWS, OONEWS, and OOONEWS files.  Changes of little
interest to users, such as code cleanups and internal details on
performance improvements, are documented in the file MODS, which
relates these changes to branches in the code repository at
github.com/radfordneal/pqR.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that for compatibility with R's version system, pqR presently
uses the same version number, 2.15.0, as the version of R on which it
is based. This allows checks for feature availability to continue to
work.  This scheme will likely change in the future.  Releases of pqR
with the same version number are distinguished by release date.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> See radfordneal.github.io/pqR for current information on pqR, including
announcements of new releases, a link to the page for making and viewing
reports of bugs and other issues, and a link to the wiki page containing
information such as systems on which pqR has been tested.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h4>FEATURE CHANGES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> A new primitive function <code>get_rm</code> has been added,
which removes a variable while returning the value it
had when removed.  See <code>help(get_rm)</code> for details,
and how this can sometimes improve efficiency of R functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> An enhanced version of the <code>Rprofmem</code> function for profiling
allocation of vectors has been implemented, that can
display more information, and can output to the terminal,
allowing the source of allocations to more easily be
determined.  Also, <code>Rprofmem</code> is now always accessible
(not requiring the <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code> configuration
option).  Its overhead when not in use is negligible.
</p>
<p>The new version allows records of memory allocation to be
output to the terminal, where their position relative to
other output can be informative (this is the default for the
new <code>Rprofmemt</code> variant).  More identifying
information, including type, number of elements, and
hexadecimal address, can also be output.  For more details on
these and other changes, see <code>help(Rprofmem)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A new primitive function, pnamedcnt, has been added, that
prints the NAMEDCNT/NAMED count for an R object, which is helpful
in tracking when objects will have to be duplicated.  For
details, see help(pnamedcnt).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>tracemem</code> function is defunct.  What exactly it was
supposed to do in R-2.15.0 was unclear, and optimizations 
in pqR make it even less clear what it should do.  The bit
in object headers that was used to implement it has been
put to a better use in pqR.  The <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code>
configuration option used to enable it no longer exists.
</p>
<p>The <code>retracemem</code> function remains for compatibility
(doing nothing).  The <code>Rprofmemt</code> and <code>pnamedcnt</code>
functions described above provide alternative ways of gaining
insight into memory allocation behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some options that can be set by arguments to the R command can
now also be set with environment variables, specifically, the
values of R_DEBUGGER, R_DEBUGGER_ARGS, and R_HELPERS give the
default when <code>--debugger</code>, <code>--debugger-args</code>, and 
<code>--helpers</code> are not specified on the command line.  This 
feature is useful when using a shell file or Makefile that contains 
R commands that one would rather not have to modify.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>INSTALLATION AND TESTING</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The procedure for compiling and installing from source is largely 
unchanged from R-2.15.0.  In particular, the final result is a 
program called &quot;R&quot;, not &quot;pqR&quot;, though of course you can provide a 
link to it called &quot;pqR&quot;.  Note that (as for R-2.15.0) it is not 
necessary to do an &quot;install&quot; after &quot;make&quot; &mdash; one can just
run bin/R in the directory where you did &quot;make&quot;.  This may be 
convenient if you wish to try out pqR along with your current 
version of R.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Testing of pqR has so far been done only on Linux/Unix
systems, not on Windows or Mac systems.  There is no specific
reason to believe that it will not work on Windows or Mac
systems, but until tests have been done, trying to use it 
on these systems is not recommended.  (However, some users
have reported that pqR can be built on Mac systems, as long
as a C compiler fully supporting OpenMP is used, or the
<code>--disable-helper-threads</code> configuration option is used.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> This release contains the versions of the standard and recommended
packages that were released with R-2.15.0.  Newer versions may
or may not be compatible (same as for R-2.15.0).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is intended that this release will be fully compatible with
R-2.15.0, but you will need to recompile any packages (other
that those with only R code) that you had installed for R-2.15.0, 
and any other C code you use with R, since the format of internal 
data structures has changed (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> New configuration options relating to helper threads and
to matrix multiplication now exist.  For details, see 
doc/R-admin.html (or R-admin.pdf), or run <code>./configure --help</code>.
</p>
<p>In particular, the <code>--disable-helper-threads</code> option
to configure will remove support for helper threads.  Use of
this option is advised if you know that multiple processors
or processor cores will not be available, or if you know that
the C compiler used does not support OpenMP 3.0 or 3.1 (which 
is used in the implementation of the helpers package).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Including <code>-DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK</code> in CFLAGS will speed up 
checks for NA and NaN on machines on which it works.  It works
on Intel processors (verified both empirically and by consulting
Intel documentation).  It does not work on SPARC machines.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>--enable-memory-profiling</code> option to configure
no longer exists.  In pqR, the <code>Rprofmem</code> function is always
enabled, and the <code>tracemem</code> function is defunct.  (See
discussion above.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When installing from source, the output of configure 
now displays whether standard and recommended packages will
be byte compiled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The tests of random number generation run with <code>make check-all</code>
now set the random number seed explicitly.  Previously, the random
number seed was set from the time and process ID, with the result
that these tests would occasionally fail non-deterministically,
when by chance one of the p-values obtained was below the threshold
used.  (Any such failure should now occur consistently, rather
than appearing to be due to a non-deterministic bug.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that (as in R-2.15.0) the output of <code>make check-all</code> for 
the boot package includes many warning messages regarding a 
non-integer argument, and when byte compilation is enabled, these 
messages identify the wrong function call as the source.  This 
appears to have no wider implications, and can be ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Testing of the &quot;xz&quot; compression method is now done with <code>try</code>,
so that failure will be tolerated on machines that don't have enough
memory for these tests.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The details of how valgrind is used have changed. See the source
file &lsquo;<span class="file">memory.c</span>&rsquo;.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The internal structure of an object has changed, in ways that 
should be compatible with R-2.15.0, but which do require 
re-compilation.  The flags in the object header for <code>DEBUG</code>,
<code>RSTEP</code>, and <code>TRACE</code> now exist only for non-vector 
objects, which is sufficient for their present use (now that 
<code>tracemem</code> is defunct).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The sizes of objects have changed in some cases (though not most).
For a 32-bit configuration, the size of a cons cell increases
from 28 bytes to 32 bytes; for a 64-bit configuration, the
size of a cons cell remains at 56 bytes.  For a 32-bit 
configuration, the size of a vector of one double remains
at 32 bytes; for a 64-bit configuration (with 8-byte alignment), 
the size of a vector of one double remains at 48 bytes.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Note that the actual amount of memory occupied by an object
depends on the set of node classes defined (which may be tuned).
There is no longer a separate node class for cons cells and
zero-length vectors (as in R-2.15.0) &mdash; instead, cons cells
share a node class with whatever vectors also fit in that
node class.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The old two-bit NAMED field of an object is now a three-bit
NAMEDCNT field, to allow for a better attempt at reference
counting.  Versions of the the NAMED and SET_NAMED macros
are still defined for compatibility.  See the R-ints manual
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Setting the length of a vector to something less than its
allocated length using SETLENGTH is deprecated.  The LENGTH
field is used for memory allocation tracking by the garbage
collector (as is also the case in R-2.15.0), so setting it 
to the wrong value may cause problems.  (Setting the length
to more than the allocated length is of course even worse.)
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Many detailed improvements have been made that reduce
general interpretive overhead and speed up particular 
functions.  Only some of these improvements are noted
below.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Numerical computations can now be performed in parallel with
each other and with interpretation of R code, by using 
&ldquo;helper threads&rdquo;, on machines
with multiple processors or multiple processor cores.  When
the output of one such computation is used as the input to
another computation, these computations can often be done
in parallel, with the output of one task being &ldquo;pipelined&rdquo;
to the other task.  Note that these 
parallel execution facilities do not require any changes to user 
code &mdash; only that helper threads be enabled with the 
<code>--helpers</code> option to the command starting pqR. See 
<code>help(helpers)</code> for details.
</p>
<p>However, helper threads are not used for operations that are 
done within the interpreter for byte-compiled code or that are 
done in primitive functions invoked by the byte-code interpreter.
</p>
<p>This facility is still undergoing rapid development.  Additional 
documentation on which operations may be done in parallel will be 
forthcoming.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A better attempt at counting how many &quot;names&quot; an object has
is now made, which reduces how often objects are duplicated
unnecessarily.  This change is ongoing, with further improvements
and documentation forthcoming.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Several primitive functions that can generate integer sequences
&mdash; &quot;:&quot;, seq.int, seq_len, and seq_along &mdash; will now sometimes
not generate an actual sequence, but rather just a description
of its start and end points.  This is not visible to users,
but is used to speed up several operations.
</p>
<p>In particular, &quot;for&quot; loops such as <code>for (i in 1:1000000) ...</code>
are now done without actually allocating a vector to hold
the sequence.  This saves both space and time.  Also,
a subscript such as <code>101:200</code> for a vector or as the first 
subscript for a matrix is now (often) handled without actually 
creating a vector of indexes, saving both time and space.  
</p>
<p>However, the above performance improvements 
are not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Matrix multiplications with the <code>%*%</code> operator are now
much faster when the operation is a vector dot product, a
vector-matrix product, a matrix-vector product, or more generally
when the sum of the numbers of rows and columns in the result
is not much less than their product.  This improvement results
from the elimination of a costly check for NA/NaN elements in the 
operands before doing the multiply.  There is no need for this check
if the supplied BLAS is used.  If a BLAS that does not properly
handle NaN is supplied, the <code>%*%</code> operator will still
handle NaN properly if the new library of matrix multiply
routines is used for <code>%*%</code> instead of the BLAS.  See the
next two items for more relevant details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A new library of matrix multiply routines is provided, which
is guaranteed to handle NA/NaN correctly, and which supports
pipelined computation with helper threads.  Whether this
library or the BLAS routines are used for <code>%*%</code> is
controlled by the <code>mat_mult_with_BLAS</code> option. The default
is to not use the BLAS, but the 
<code>--enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-by-default</code> configuration option
will change this.  See <code>help("%*%")</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The BLAS routines supplied with R were modified to improve the 
performance of the routines DGEMM (matrix-matrix multiply) and 
DGEMV (matrix-vector multiply).  Also, proper propagation of NaN, 
Inf, etc. is now always done in these routines.  This speeds
up the <code>%*%</code> operator in R, when the supplied BLAS is used
for matrix multiplications, and speeds up other matrix operations
that call these BLAS routines, if the BLAS used is the one supplied.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The low-level routines for generation of uniform random
numbers have been improved.  (These routines are also used for
higher-level functions such as <code>rnorm</code>.)
</p>
<p>The previous code copied the seed back and forth to
.Random.seed for every call of a random number generation
function, which is rather time consuming given that for
the default generator <code>.Random.seed</code> is 625 integers long.
It also allocated new space for <code>.Random.seed</code> every time.
Now, <code>.Random.seed</code> is used without copying, except when the 
generator is user-supplied.  
</p>
<p>The previous code had imposed an unnecessary limit on the
length of a seed for a user-supplied random number
generator, which has now been removed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> primitives have been substantially
sped up for large vectors.  
</p>
<p>Also, expressions such as
<code>all(v&gt;0)</code> and <code>any(is.na(v))</code>, where <code>v</code> is a
real vector, avoid computing and storing a logical vector,
instead computing the result of <code>any</code> or <code>all</code>
without this intermediate, looking at only as much of <code>v</code>
as is needed to determine the result.
However, this improvement is not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> When <code>sum</code> is applied to many mathematical functions
of one vector argument, for example <code>sum(log(v))</code>, the
sum is performed as the function is computed, without a
vector being allocated to hold the function values.  
However, this improvement is not effective in compiled code.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The handling of power operations has been improved (primarily 
for powers of reals, but slightly affecting powers of integers too).
In particular, scalar powers of 2, 1, 0, and -1, are handled 
specially to avoid general power operations in these cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Extending lists and character vectors by assigning to an
index past the end, and deleting list items by assigning NULL
have been sped up substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The speed of the transpose (<code>t</code>) function has been
improved, when applied to real, integer, and logical
matrices.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>cbind</code> and <code>rbind</code> functions have been greatly
sped up for large objects.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>c</code> and <code>unlist</code> functions have been sped up 
by a bit in simple cases, and by a lot in some situations 
involving names.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>matrix</code> function has been greatly sped up, in
many cases.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Extraction of subsets of vectors or matrices (eg, <code>v[100:200]</code>
or <code>M[1:100,101:110]</code>) has been sped up substantially.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Logical operations and relational operators have been sped up
in simple cases. Relational
operators have also been substantially sped up for long vectors.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Access via the $ operator to lists, pairlists, and environments 
has been sped up. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Existing code for handling special cases of &quot;[&quot; in which there is
only one scalar index was replaced by cleaner code that handles 
more cases.   The old code handled only integer and real vectors, 
and only positive indexes.  The new code handles all atomic 
vectors (logical, integer, real, complex, raw, and string), and 
positive or negative indexes that are not out of bounds.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Many unary and binary primitive functions are now usually
called using a faster internal interface that does not allocate
nodes for a pairlist of evaluated arguments. This change
substantially speeds up some programs.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Lookup of some builtin/special function symbols (eg, &quot;+&quot; and &quot;if&quot;)
has been sped up by allowing fast bypass of non-global environments
that do not contain (and have never contained) one of these 
symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some binary and unary arithmetic operations have been sped
up by, when possible, using the space holding one of the
operands to hold the result, rather than allocating new
space.  Though primarily a speed improvement, for very
long vectors avoiding this allocation could avoid running
out of space.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some speedup has been obtained by using new internal C functions 
for performing exact or partial string matches in the interpreter.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> The &quot;debug&quot; facility has been fixed.  Its behaviour for if,
while, repeat, and for statements when the inner statement
was or was not one with curly brackets had made no sense.
The fixed behaviour is now documented in help(debug). 
(I reported this bug and how
to fix it to the R Core Team in July 2012, but the bug is 
still present in R-3.0.1, released May 2013.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in <code>sum</code>, where overflow is allowed (and not 
detected) where overflow can actually be avoided.  For example:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; v&lt;-c(3L,1000000000L:1010000000L,-(1000000000L:1010000000L))
   &gt; sum(v)
   [1] 4629
</PRE>
Also fixed a related bug in <code>mean</code>, applied to an integer
vector, which would arise only on a system where a long double 
is no bigger than a double.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed <code>diag</code> so that it returns a matrix when passed
a list of elements to put on the diagonal.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug that could lead to mis-identification of the 
direction of stack growth on a non-Windows system, causing
stack overflow to not be detected, and a segmentation fault 
to occur.  (I also reported this bug and how to fix it to the 
R Core Team, who included a fix in R-2.15.2.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where, for example, <code>log(base=4)</code> returned 
the natural log of 4, rather than signalling an error. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation on what <code>MARGIN</code> arguments are allowed for
<code>apply</code> has been clarified, and checks for validity added.
The call 
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; apply(array(1:24,c(2,3,4)),-3,sum)
</PRE>
now produces correct results (the same as when <code>MARGIN</code>
is <code>1:2</code>).
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in which <code>Im(matrix(complex(0),3,4))</code> returned
a matrix of zero elements rather than a matrix of NA elements.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where more than six warning messages at startup
would overwrite random memory, causing garbage output 
and perhaps arbitrarily bizarre behaviour.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where LC_PAPER was not correctly set at startup.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed gc.time, which was producing grossly incorrect values
for user and system time.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Now check for bad arguments for .rowSums, .colSums, .rowMeans,
and .rowMeans (would previously segfault if n*p too big).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug where excess warning messages may be produced
on conversion to RAW.  For instance:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; as.raw(1e40)
   [1] 00
   Warning messages:
   1: NAs introduced by coercion 
   2: out-of-range values treated as 0 in coercion to raw 
</PRE>
Now, only the second warning message is produced.
</li>
<li><p> A bug has been fixed in which rbind would not handle 
non-vector objects such as function closures, whereas
cbind did handle them, and both were documented to do so.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in numeric_deriv in stats/src/nls.c, where it
was not duplicating when it should, as illustrated below:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; x &lt;- 5; y &lt;- 2; f &lt;- function (y) x
   &gt; numericDeriv(f(y),"y")
    [1] 5
    attr(,"gradient")
         [,1]
    [1,]    0
    &gt; x
    [1] 5
    attr(,"gradient")
         [,1]
    [1,]    0
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in vapply illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   X&lt;-list(456)
   f&lt;-function(a)X
   A&lt;-list(1,2)  
   B&lt;-vapply(A,f,list(0))
   print(B)
   X[[1]][1]&lt;-444
   print(B)
</PRE>
After the fix, the values in <code>B</code> are no long changed by the 
assignment to <code>X</code>. Similar bugs in mapply, eapply, and rapply 
have also been fixed.  I reported these bugs to r-devel, and
(different) fixes are in R-3.0.0 and later versions.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a but in rep.int illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-list(1,2)
   b&lt;-rep.int(a,c(2,2))
   b[[1]][1]&lt;-9
   print(a[[1]])
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug in mget, illustrated by the following code:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- numeric(1)
   x &lt;- mget("a",as.environment(1))
   print(x)
   a[1] &lt;- 9
   print(x)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs that the R Core Team fixed (differently) for R-2.15.3,
illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(c(1,2),c(3,4))
   b &lt;- list(1,2,3)
   b[2:3] &lt;- a
   b[[2]][2] &lt;- 99
   print(a[[1]][2])

   a &lt;- list(1+1,1+1)
   b &lt;- list(1,1,1,1)
   b[1:4] &lt;- a
   b[[1]][1] &lt;- 1
   print(b[2:4])
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   &gt; library(compiler)
   &gt; foo &lt;- function(x,y) UseMethod("foo")
   &gt; foo.numeric &lt;- function(x,y) "numeric"
   &gt; foo.default &lt;- function(x,y) "default"
   &gt; testi &lt;- function () foo(x=NULL,2)
   &gt; testc &lt;- cmpfun (function () foo(x=NULL,2))
   &gt; testi() 
   [1] "default"
   &gt; testc()
   [1] "numeric"
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed several bugs that produced wrong results 
such as the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a&lt;-list(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6))
   b&lt;-a[2:3]
   a[[2]][2]&lt;-9
   print(b[[1]][2])
</PRE>
I reported this to r-devel, and a (different) fix is in R-3.0.0 and 
later versions.
</li>
<li><p> Fixed bugs reported on r-devel by Justin Talbot, Jan 2013 (also
fixed, differently, in R-2.15.3), illustrated by the following:
</p>
<PRE>   a &lt;- list(1)
   b &lt;- (a[[1]] &lt;- a)
   print(b)
   a &lt;- list(x=1)
   b &lt;- (a$x &lt;- a)
   print(b)
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed <code>svd</code> so that it will not return a list with
<code>NULL</code> elements.  This matches the behaviour of <code>La.svd</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed (by a kludge, not a proper fix) a bug in the &quot;tre&quot;
package for regular expression matching (eg, in <code>sub</code>),
which shows up when <code>WCHAR_MAX</code> doesn't fit in an
&quot;int&quot;.  The kludge reduces <code>WCHAR_MAX</code> to fit, but really
the &quot;int&quot; variables ought to be bigger.  (This problem
showed up on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a minor error-reporting bug with
<code>(1:2):integer(0)</code> and similar expressions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a small error-reporting bug with &quot;$&quot;,
illustrated by the following output:
</p>
<PRE>    &gt; options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE)
    &gt; pl &lt;- pairlist(abc=1,def=2)
    &gt; pl$ab
    [1] 1
    Warning message:
    In pl$ab : partial match of 'ab' to ''
</PRE>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed documentation error in R-admin regarding the
<code>--disable-byte-compiled-packages</code> configuration option, 
and changed the DESCRIPTION file for the recommended mgcv 
package to respect this option.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Fixed a bug reported to R Core (PR 15363, 2013-006-26) that
also existed in pqR-2013-06-20.  This bug sometimes caused memory
expansion when many complex assignments or removals were done
in the global environment.
</p>
