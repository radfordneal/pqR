pqR News

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-05-31:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This is the initial public release of pqR.  It is based on
      R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but improves on it in
      many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but also by implementing
      some new features and fixing some bugs.

    o One notable improvement is that for systems with multiple
      processors or processor cores, pqR is able to do some numeric
      computations in parallel with other operations of the
      interpreter, and with other numeric computations.

    o This section documents changes in pqR from R-2.15.0 that are of
      direct interest to users.  For changes from earlier version of R
      to R-2.15.0, see the ONEWS, OONEWS, and OOONEWS files.  Changes
      of little interest to users, such as code cleanups and internal
      details on performance improvements, are documented in the file
      MODS, which relates these changes to branches in the code
      repository at github.com/radfordneal/pqR.

    o Note that for compatibility with R's version system, pqR
      presently uses the same version number, 2.15.0, as the version of
      R on which it is based. This allows checks for feature
      availability to continue to work.  This scheme will likely change
      in the future.  Releases of pqR with the same version number are
      distinguished by release date.

  NEW FEATURES:

    o A new primitive function get_rm has been added, which removes a
      variable while returning the value it had when removed.  See
      help(get_rm) for details, and how this can sometimes improve
      efficiency of R functions.

    o An enhanced version of the Rprofmem function for profiling
      allocation of vectors has been implemented, that can display more
      information, and can output to the terminal, allowing the source
      of allocations to more easily be determined.  Also, Rprofmem has
      now been made accessible even when the --enable-memory-profiling
      configuration option is not used, since the overhead of making it
      accessible is negligible.

      The new version allows records of memory allocation to be output
      to the terminal, where their position relative to other output
      can be informative.  More identifying information, including
      type, number of elements, and hexadecimal address, can also be
      output.  For more details on these and other changes, see
      help(Rprofmem).

    o A new primitive function, pnamedcnt, has been added, that prints
      the NAMEDCNT/NAMED count for an R object, which is helpful in
      tracking when objects will have to be duplicated.  For details,
      see help(pnamedcnt).

    o Some options that can be set by arguments to the R command can
      now also be set with environment variables, specifically, the
      values of R_DEBUGGER, R_DEBUGGER_ARGS, and R_HELPERS give the
      default when --debugger, --debugger-args, and --helpers are not
      specified on the command line.  This feature is useful when using
      a shell file or Makefile that contains R commands that one would
      rather not have to modify.

  INSTALLATION AND TESTING:

    o Testing of pqR has so far been done only on Linux/Unix systems,
      not on Windows or Mac systems.  There is no specific reason to
      believe that it will not work on Windows or Mac systems, but
      until tests have been done, trying to use it on these systems is
      not recommended.

    o New configuration options relating to helper threads and to
      matrix multiplication now exist.  See doc/R-admin.html (or
      R-admin.pdf) for details.

    o When installing from source, the output of ./configure now
      displays whether base and recommended packages will be byte
      compiled.

    o The tests of random number generation run with make check-all now
      set the random number seed explicitly.  Previously, the random
      number seed was set from the time and process ID, with the result
      that these tests would occasionally fail non-deterministically,
      when by chance one of the p-values obtained was below the
      threshold used.  (Any such failure should now occur consistently,
      rather than appearing to be due to a non-deterministic bug.)

    o Note that the output of make check-all for the boot package
      includes many warning messages regarding a non-integer argument,
      and when byte compilation is enabled, these messages identify the
      wrong function call as the source.  This appears to have no wider
      implications, and can be ignored.

    o The details of how valgrind is used have changed. See the source
      file memory.c.

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o Many detailed improvements have been made that reduce general
      interpretive overhead and speed up particular functions.  Only
      some of these improvements are noted below.

    o Numerical computations can now be performed in parallel with each
      other and with interpretation of R code, by using ``helper
      threads'', on machines with multiple processors or multiple
      processor cores.  When the output of one such computation is used
      as the input to another computation, these computations can often
      be done in parallel, with the output of one task being
      ``pipelined'' to the other task.  Note that these parallel
      execution facilities do not require any changes to user code -
      only that helper threads be enabled with the --helpers option to
      the command starting pqR. See help(helpers) for details.

      This facility is still undergoing rapid development.  Additional
      documentation on which operations may be done in parallel will be
      forthcoming.

    o Several primitive functions that can generate integer sequences -
      ":", seq.int, seq_len, and seq_along - will now sometimes not
      generate an actual sequence, but rather just a description of its
      start and end points.  This is not visible to users, but is used
      to speed up several operations.

      In particular, "for" loops such as for (i in 1:1000000) ...  are
      now done without actually allocating a vector to hold the
      sequence.  This saves both space and time.  Also, a subscript
      such as 101:200 for a vector or as the first subscript for a
      matrix is now (often) handled without actually creating a vector
      of indexes, saving both time and space.

      However, the above performance improvements are not effective in
      compiled code.

    o Matrix multiplications with the %*% operator are now much faster
      when the operation is a vector dot product, a vector-matrix
      product, a matrix-vector product, or more generally when the sum
      of the numbers of rows and columns in the result is not much less
      than their product.  This improvement results from the
      elimination of a costly check for NA/NaN elements in the operands
      before doing the multiply.  There is no need for this check if
      the supplied BLAS is used.  If a BLAS that does not properly
      handle NaN is supplied, the %*% operator will still handle NaN
      properly if the new library of matrix multiply routines is used
      for %*% instead of the BLAS.  See the next two items for more
      relevant details.

    o A new library of matrix multiply routines is provided, which is
      guaranteed to handle NA/NaN correctly, and which supports
      pipelined computation with helper threads.  Whether this library
      or the BLAS routines are used for %*% is controlled by the
      mat_mult_with_BLAS option. The default is to not use the BLAS,
      but the --enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-by-default configuration
      option will change this.  See help("%*%") for details.

    o The BLAS routines supplied with R were modified to improve the
      performance of the routines DGEMM (matrix-matrix multiply) and
      DGEMV (matrix-vector multiply).  Also, proper propagation of NaN,
      Inf, etc. is now always done in these routines.  This speeds up
      the %*% operator in R, when the supplied BLAS is used for matrix
      multiplications, and speeds up other matrix operations that call
      these BLAS routines, if the BLAS used is the one supplied.

    o The low-level routines for generation of uniform random numbers
      have been improved.  (These routines are also used for
      higher-level functions such as rnorm.)

      The previous code copied the seed back and forth to .Random.seed
      for every call of a random number generation function, which is
      rather time consuming given that for the default generator
      .Random.seed is 625 integers long.  It also allocated new space
      for .Random.seed every time.  Now, .Random.seed is used without
      copying, except when the generator is user-supplied.

      The previous code had imposed an unnecessary limit on the length
      of a seed for a user-supplied random number generator, which has
      now been removed.

    o The any and all primitives have been substantially sped up for
      large vectors.

      Also, expressions such as all(v>0) and any(is.na(v)), where v is
      a real vector, avoid computing and storing a logical vector,
      instead computing the result of any or all without this
      intermediate, looking at only as much of v as is needed to
      determine the result.  However, this improvement is not effective
      in compiled code.

    o When sum is applied to many mathematical functions of one vector
      argument, for example sum(log(v)), the sum is performed as the
      function is computed, without a vector being allocated to hold
      the function values.  However, this improvement is not effective
      in compiled code.

    o The handling of power operations has been improved (primarily for
      powers of reals, but slightly affecting powers of integers too).
      In particular, scalar powers of 2, 1, 0, and -1, are handled
      specially to avoid general power operations in these cases.

    o Extending lists and character vectors by assigning to an index
      past the end, and deleting list items by assigning NULL have been
      sped up substantially.

    o The speed of the transpose (t) function has been improved, when
      applied to real, integer, and logical matrices.

    o The cbind and rbind functions have been greatly sped up for large
      objects.

    o The c and unlist functions have been sped up by a bit in simple
      cases, and by a lot in some situations involving names.

    o The matrix function has been greatly sped up, in many cases.

    o Extraction of subsets of vectors or matrices (eg, v[100:200] or
      M[1:100,101:110]) has been sped up substantially.

    o Logical operations and relational operators have been sped up in
      simple cases. Relational operators have also been substantially
      sped up for long vectors.

    o Access via the $ operator to lists, pairlists, and environments
      has been sped up.

    o Existing code for handling special cases of "[" in which there is
      only one scalar index was replaced by cleaner code that handles
      more cases.  The old code handled only integer and real vectors,
      and only positive indexes.  The new code handles all atomic
      vectors (logical, integer, real, complex, raw, and string), and
      positive or negative indexes that are not out of bounds.

    o Many unary and binary primitive functions are now usually called
      using a faster internal interface that does not allocate nodes
      for a pairlist of evaluated arguments. This change substantially
      speeds up some programs.

    o Lookup of some builtin/special function symbols (eg, "+" and
      "if") has been sped up by allowing fast bypass of non-global
      environments that do not contain (and have never contained) one
      of these symbols.

    o Some binary and unary arithmetic operations have been sped up by,
      when possible, using the space holding one of the operands to
      hold the result, rather than allocating new space.  Though
      primarily a speed improvement, for very long vectors avoiding
      this allocation could avoid running out of space.

    o Some speedup has been obtained by using new internal C functions
      for performing exact or partial string matches in the
      interpreter.

  BUG FIXES:

    o The "debug" facility has been fixed.  Its behaviour for if,
      while, repeat, and for statements when the inner statement was or
      was not one with curly brackets had made no sense.  The fixed
      behaviour is now documented in help(debug).  (I reported this bug
      and how to fix it to the R Core Team in July 2012, but the bug is
      still present in R-3.0.1, released May 2013.)

    o Fixed a bug in sum, where overflow is allowed (and not detected)
      where overflow can actually be avoided.  For example:
      
         > v<-c(3L,1000000000L:1010000000L,-(1000000000L:1010000000L))
         > sum(v)
         [1] 4629

      Also fixed a related bug in mean, applied to an integer vector,
      which would arise only on a system where a long double is no
      bigger than a double.

    o Fixed diag so that it returns a matrix when passed a list of
      elements to put on the diagonal.

    o Fixed a bug that could lead to mis-identification of the
      direction of stack growth on a non-Windows system, causing stack
      overflow to not be detected, and a segmentation fault to occur.
      (I also reported this bug and how to fix it to the R Core Team,
      who included a fix in R-2.15.2.)

    o Fixed a bug where, for example, log(base=4) returned the natural
      log of 4, rather than signalling an error.

    o The documentation on what MARGIN arguments are allowed for apply
      has been clarified, and checks for validity added.  The call
      
         > apply(array(1:24,c(2,3,4)),-3,sum)

      now produces correct results (the same as when MARGIN is 1:2).

    o Fixed a bug in which Im(matrix(complex(0),3,4)) returned a matrix
      of zero elements rather than a matrix of NA elements.

    o Fixed a bug where more than six warning messages at startup would
      overwrite random memory, causing garbage output and perhaps
      arbitrarily bizarre behaviour.

    o Fixed a bug where LC_PAPER was not correctly set at startup.

    o Fixed gc.time, which was producing grossly incorrect values for
      user and system time.

    o Now check for bad arguments for .rowSums, .colSums, .rowMeans,
      and .rowMeans (would previously segfault if n*p too big).

    o Fixed a bug where excess warning messages may be produced on
      conversion to RAW.  For instance:
      
         > as.raw(1e40)
         [1] 00
         Warning messages:
         1: NAs introduced by coercion 
         2: out-of-range values treated as 0 in coercion to raw 

      Now, only the second warning message is produced.

    o A bug has been fixed in which rbind would not handle non-vector
      objects such as function closures, whereas cbind did handle them,
      and both were documented to do so.

    o Fixed a bug in numeric_deriv in stats/src/nls.c, where it was not
      duplicating when it should, as illustrated below:
      
         > x <- 5; y <- 2; f <- function (y) x
         > numericDeriv(f(y),"y")
          [1] 5
          attr(,"gradient")
               [,1]
          [1,]    0
          > x
          [1] 5
          attr(,"gradient")
               [,1]
          [1,]    0

    o Fixed a bug in vapply illustrated by the following:
      
         X<-list(456)
         f<-function(a)X
         A<-list(1,2)  
         B<-vapply(A,f,list(0))
         print(B)
         X[[1]][1]<-444
         print(B)

      After the fix, the values in B are no long changed by the
      assignment to X. Similar bugs in mapply, eapply, and rapply have
      also been fixed.  I reported these bugs to r-devel, and
      (different) fixes are in R-3.0.0 and later versions.

    o Fixed a but in rep.int illustrated by the following:
      
         a<-list(1,2)
         b<-rep.int(a,c(2,2))
         b[[1]][1]<-9
         print(a[[1]])

    o Fixed a bug in mget, illustrated by the following code:
      
         a <- numeric(1)
         x <- mget("a",as.environment(1))
         print(x)
         a[1] <- 9
         print(x)

    o Fixed bugs that the R Core Team fixed (differently) for R-2.15.3,
      illustrated by the following:
      
         a <- list(c(1,2),c(3,4))
         b <- list(1,2,3)
         b[2:3] <- a
         b[[2]][2] <- 99
         print(a[[1]][2])
      
         a <- list(1+1,1+1)
         b <- list(1,1,1,1)
         b[1:4] <- a
         b[[1]][1] <- 1
         print(b[2:4])

    o Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
      
         > library(compiler)
         > foo <- function(x,y) UseMethod("foo")
         > foo.numeric <- function(x,y) "numeric"
         > foo.default <- function(x,y) "default"
         > testi <- function () foo(x=NULL,2)
         > testc <- cmpfun (function () foo(x=NULL,2))
         > testi() 
         [1] "default"
         > testc()
         [1] "numeric"

    o Fixed several bugs that produced wrong results such as the
      following:
      
         a<-list(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6))
         b<-a[2:3]
         a[[2]][2]<-9
         print(b[[1]][2])

      I reported this to r-devel, and a (different) fix is in R-3.0.0
      and later versions.

    o Fixed bugs reported on r-devel by Justin Talbot, Jan 2013 (also
      fixed, differently, in R-2.15.3), illustrated by the following:
      
         a <- list(1)
         b <- (a[[1]] <- a)
         print(b)
         a <- list(x=1)
         b <- (a$x <- a)
         print(b)

    o Fixed svd so that it will not return a list with NULL elements.
      This matches the behaviour of La.svd.

    o Fixed a minor error-reporting bug with (1:2):integer(0) and
      similar expressions.

    o Fixed a small error-reporting bug with "$", illustrated by the
      following output:
      
          > options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE)
          > pl <- pairlist(abc=1,def=2)
          > pl$ab
          [1] 1
          Warning message:
          In pl$ab : partial match of 'ab' to ''

    o Fixed documentation error in R-admin regarding the
      --disable-byte-compiled-packages configuration option, and
      changed the DESCRIPTION file for the recommended mgcv package to
      respect this option.
