Trio is intended to be an integral part of another application, so we
have not done anything to create a proper installation.

Compile with 'make' (edit the Makefile if you want a release build)

Test the package with 'make test'

Install by copying trio.h, triop.h, and libtrio.a (and man/man?/* if
you want documentation) to the appropriate directories.

Catch some usage examples in example.c
