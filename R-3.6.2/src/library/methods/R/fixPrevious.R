## fixPre1.8(names)
##   The objects in names should have been loaded from a version of R
##   previous to 1.8.0
##   The classes of these objects must be defined in the current session.
##   Objects are modified to have the correct version of its class,
##   and re-assigned.
##
##   The function checks for existence and consistency of class definitions.
