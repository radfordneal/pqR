  This is one of the Harvard PRIM-H project data sets.  They in turn
  obtained it from Dr. John Woodhouse, Dept. of Geophysics, Harvard
  University.
}
\details{
  There are two clear planes of seismic activity.  One is a major plate
  junction; the other is the Tonga trench off New Zealand.  These data
  constitute a subsample from a larger dataset of containing 5000
  observations.
