\description{
  Results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried

  conditions.
}
\usage{PlantGrowth}
\format{
  A data frame of 30 cases on 2 variables.

  \tabular{rll}{
    [, 1] \tab weight \tab numeric \cr
    [, 2] \tab group  \tab factor
  }

\examples{
## One factor ANOVA example from Dobson's book, cf. Table 7.4:
require(stats); require(graphics)
boxplot(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, main = "PlantGrowth data",
        ylab = "Dried weight of plants", col = "lightgray",
        notch = TRUE, varwidth = TRUE)
anova(lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth))
