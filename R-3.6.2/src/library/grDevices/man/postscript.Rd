\usage{
postscript(file = if(onefile) "Rplots.ps" else "Rplot\%03d.ps",
           onefile, family, title, fonts, encoding, bg, fg,
           width, height, horizontal, pointsize,
           paper, pagecentre, print.it, command,
           colormodel, useKerning, fillOddEven)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a character string giving the name of the file.  If it is
    \code{""}, the output is piped to the command given by the argument
    \code{command}.
    If it is of the form \code{"|cmd"}, the output is piped to the
    command given by \command{cmd}.

    For use with \code{onefile = FALSE} give a \code{printf} format such
    as \code{"Rplot\%03d.ps"} (the default in that case).  The string
    should not otherwise contain a \code{\%}: if it is really necessary,
    use \code{\%\%} in the string for \code{\%} in the file name.
    A single integer format matching the \link{regular expression}
    \code{"\%[#0 +=-]*[0-9.]*[diouxX]"} is allowed.

    Tilde expansion (see \code{\link{path.expand}}) is done.
  }
  \item{onefile}{logical: if true (the default) allow multiple figures
    in one file.  If false, generate a file name containing the page
    number for each page and use an EPSF header and no
    \code{DocumentMedia} comment.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{family}{the initial font family to be used, normally as a
    character string.  See the section \sQuote{Families}.  Defaults to
    \code{"Helvetica"}.}
  \item{title}{title string to embed as the \code{Title} comment in the
    file.  Defaults to \code{"R Graphics Output"}.}
  \item{fonts}{a character vector specifying additional \R graphics font
    family names for font families whose declarations will be included
    in the PostScript file and are available for use with the device.
    See \sQuote{Families} below.  Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
  \item{encoding}{the name of an encoding file.  Defaults to
    \code{"default"}.  The latter is interpreted
    \describe{
      \item{on Unix-alikes}{
	as \file{"ISOLatin1.enc"} unless the locale is recognized as
    corresponding to a language using ISO 8859-\{2,5,7,13,15\} or KOI8-\{R,U\}.
      }
      \item{on Windows}{
    as \file{"CP1250.enc"} (Central European), \code{"CP1251.enc"} (Cyrillic),
    \code{"CP1253.enc"} (Greek) or \code{"CP1257.enc"} (Baltic) if one
    of those codepages is in use, otherwise \file{"WinAnsi.enc"}
    (codepage 1252).
      }
    }
    The file is looked for in the \file{enc} directory of package
    \pkg{grDevices} if the path does not contain a path separator.  An
    extension \code{".enc"} can be omitted.
  }
  \item{bg}{the initial background color to be used.  If
    \code{"transparent"} (or any other non-opaque colour), no background
    is painted.  Defaults to \code{"transparent"}.}
  \item{fg}{the initial foreground color to be used.  Defaults to
    \code{"black"}.}
  \item{width, height}{the width and height of the graphics region in
    inches.  Default to \code{0}.

    If \code{paper != "special"} and \code{width} or \code{height} is less
    than \code{0.1} or too large to give a total margin of 0.5 inch, the
    graphics region is reset to the corresponding paper dimension minus 0.5.
  }
  \item{horizontal}{the orientation of the printed image, a logical.
    Defaults to true, that is landscape orientation on paper sizes
    with width less than height.}
  \item{pointsize}{the default point size to be used.  Strictly
    speaking, in bp, that is 1/72 of an inch, but approximately in
    points.  Defaults to \code{12}.}
  \item{paper}{the size of paper in the printer.  The choices are
    \code{"a4"}, \code{"letter"} (or \code{"us"}), \code{"legal"} and
    \code{"executive"} (and these can be capitalized).
    Also, \code{"special"} can be used, when arguments \code{width}
    and \code{height} specify the paper size.  A further choice is
    \code{"default"} (the default): If this is selected, the papersize
    is taken from the option \code{"papersize"} if that is set and to
    \code{"a4"} if it is unset or empty.}
  \item{pagecentre}{logical: should the device region be centred on the
    page?  Defaults to true.}
  \item{print.it}{logical: should the file be printed when the device is
    closed?  (This only applies if \code{file} is a real file name.)
    Defaults to false.}
  \item{command}{the command to be used for \sQuote{printing}.  Defaults
    to \code{"default"}, the value of option \code{"printcmd"}.  The
    length limit is \code{2*PATH_MAX},
    typically 8096 bytes on Unix-alikes and 520 bytes on Windows.
  }
  \item{colormodel}{a character string describing the color model:
    currently allowed values as \code{"srgb"}, \code{"srgb+gray"},
    \code{"rgb"}, \code{"rgb-nogray"}, \code{"gray"} (or \code{"grey")} and
    \code{"cmyk"}.  Defaults to \code{"srgb"}.  See section
    \sQuote{Color models}.}
  \item{useKerning}{logical.  Should kerning corrections be included in
    setting text and calculating string widths?  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{fillOddEven}{logical controlling the polygon fill mode:  see
      \code{\link{polygon}} for details.  Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\details{
  All arguments except \code{file} default to values given by
  \code{\link{ps.options}()}.  The ultimate defaults are quoted in the
  arguments section.

  \code{postscript} opens the file \code{file} and the PostScript
  commands needed to plot any graphics requested are written to that
  file.  This file can then be printed on a suitable device to obtain
  hard copy.

  The \code{file} argument is interpreted as a C integer format as used
  by \code{\link{sprintf}}, with integer argument the page number.
  The default gives files \file{Rplot001.ps}, \dots, \file{Rplot999.ps},
  \file{Rplot1000.ps}, \dots.

  The postscript produced for a single \R plot is EPS (\emph{Encapsulated
    PostScript}) compatible, and can be included into other documents,
  e.g., into LaTeX, using \code{\\includegraphics{<filename>}}.  For use
  in this way you will probably want to use \code{\link{setEPS}()} to
  set the defaults as \code{horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE, paper =
    "special"}.  Note that the bounding box is for the \emph{device}
  region: if you find the white space around the plot region excessive,
  reduce the margins of the figure region via \code{\link{par}(mar = )}.

  Most of the PostScript prologue used is taken from the \R character
  vector \code{.ps.prolog}.  This is marked in the output, and can be
  changed by changing that vector.  (This is only advisable for
  PostScript experts: the standard version is in
  \code{namespace:grDevices}.)

  A PostScript device has a default family, which can be set by the user
  via \code{family}.  If other font families are to be used when drawing
  to the PostScript device, these must be declared when the device is
  created via \code{fonts};  the font family names for this argument are
  \R graphics font family names (see the documentation for
  \code{\link{postscriptFonts}}).

  Line widths as controlled by \code{par(lwd = )} are in multiples of
  1/96 inch: multiples less than 1 are allowed.  \code{pch = "."} with
  \code{cex = 1} corresponds to a square of side 1/72 inch, which is
  also the \sQuote{pixel} size assumed for graphics parameters such as
  \code{"cra"}.

  When the background colour is fully transparent (as is the initial
  default value), the PostScript produced does not paint the
  background. Almost all PostScript viewers will use a white canvas so
  the visual effect is if the background were white.  This will not be
  the case when printing onto coloured paper, though.
}

\section{Families}{
  Font families are collections of fonts covering the five font faces,
  (conventionally plain, bold, italic, bold-italic and symbol) selected
  by the graphics parameter \code{\link{par}(font = )} or the grid
  parameter \code{\link{gpar}(fontface = )}.  Font families can be
  specified either as an an initial/default font family for the device
  via the \code{family} argument or after the device is opened by
  the graphics parameter \code{\link{par}(family = )} or the grid
  parameter \code{\link{gpar}(fontfamily = )}.  Families which will be
  used in addition to the initial family must be specified in the
  \code{fonts} argument when the device is opened.

  Font families are declared via a call to \code{\link{postscriptFonts}}.

  The argument \code{family} specifies the initial/default font family
  to be used.  In normal use it is one of \code{"AvantGarde"},
  \code{"Bookman"}, \code{"Courier"}, \code{"Helvetica"},
  \code{"Helvetica-Narrow"}, \code{"NewCenturySchoolbook"},
  \code{"Palatino"} or \code{"Times"}, and refers to the standard Adobe
  PostScript fonts families of those names which are included (or
  cloned) in all common PostScript devices.

  Many PostScript emulators (including those based on
  \code{ghostscript}) use the URW equivalents of these fonts, which are
  \code{"URWGothic"}, \code{"URWBookman"}, \code{"NimbusMon"},
  \code{"NimbusSan"}, \code{"NimbusSanCond"}, \code{"CenturySch"},
  \code{"URWPalladio"} and \code{"NimbusRom"} respectively.  If your
  PostScript device is using URW fonts, you will obtain access to more
  characters and more appropriate metrics by using these names.  To make
  these easier to remember, \code{"URWHelvetica" == "NimbusSan"} and
  \code{"URWTimes" == "NimbusRom"} are also supported.

  Another type of family makes use of CID-keyed fonts for East Asian
  languages -- see \code{\link{postscriptFonts}}.

  The \code{family} argument is normally a character string naming a
  font family, but family objects generated by \code{\link{Type1Font}}
  and \code{\link{CIDFont}} are also accepted.  For compatibility with
  earlier versions of \R, the initial family can also be specified as a
  vector of four or five afm files.

  Note that \R does not embed the font(s) used in the PostScript output:
  see \code{\link{embedFonts}} for a utility to help do so.

  Viewers and embedding applications frequently substitute fonts for
  those specified in the family, and the substitute will often have
  slightly different font metrics. \code{useKerning = TRUE} spaces the
  letters in the string using kerning corrections for the intended
  family: this may look uglier than \code{useKerning = FALSE}.
}

\section{Encodings}{
  Encodings describe which glyphs are used to display the character codes
  (in the range 0--255).  Most commonly \R uses ISOLatin1 encoding, and
  the examples for \code{\link{text}} are in that encoding.  However,
  the encoding used on machines running \R may well be different, and by
  using the \code{encoding} argument the glyphs can be matched to
  encoding in use.  This suffices for European and Cyrillic languages,
  but not for East Asian languages.  For the latter, composite CID fonts are
  used.  These fonts are useful for other languages: for example they
  may contain Greek glyphs. (The rest of this section applies only when CID
  fonts are not used.)

  None of this will matter if only ASCII characters (codes 32--126) are
  used as all the encodings (except \code{"TeXtext"}) agree over that
  range.  Some encodings are supersets of ISOLatin1, too.  However, if
  accented and special characters do not come out as you expect, you may
  need to change the encoding.  Some other encodings are supplied with
  \R: \code{"WinAnsi.enc"} and \code{"MacRoman.enc"} correspond to the
  encodings normally used on Windows and Classic Mac OS (at least by
  Adobe), and \code{"PDFDoc.enc"} is the first 256 characters of the
  Unicode encoding, the standard for PDF.  There are also encodings
  \code{"ISOLatin2.enc"}, \code{"CP1250.enc"}, \code{"ISOLatin7.enc"}
  (ISO 8859-13), \code{"CP1257.enc"}, and \code{"ISOLatin9.enc"} (ISO
  8859-15), \code{"Cyrillic.enc"} (ISO 8859-5), \code{"KOI8-R.enc"},
  \code{"KOI8-U.enc"}, \code{"CP1251.enc"}, \code{"Greek.enc"} (ISO
  8859-7) and \code{"CP1253.enc"}.  Note that many glyphs in these
  encodings are not in the fonts corresponding to the standard families.
  (The Adobe ones for all but Courier, Helvetica and Times cover little
  more than Latin-1, whereas the URW ones also cover Latin-2, Latin-7,
  Latin-9 and Cyrillic but no Greek.  The Adobe exceptions cover the
  Latin character sets, but not the Euro.)

  If you specify the encoding, it is your responsibility to ensure that
  the PostScript font contains the glyphs used.  One issue here is the Euro
  symbol which is in the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings but may well not
  be in the PostScript fonts.  (It is in the URW variants; it is not in
  the supplied Adobe Font Metric files.)

  There is an exception.  Character 45 (\code{"-"}) is always set
  as minus (its value in Adobe ISOLatin1) even though it is hyphen in
  the other encodings.  Hyphen is available as character 173 (octal
  0255) in all the Latin encodings, Cyrillic and Greek.  (This can be
  entered as \code{"\uad"} in a UTF-8 locale.)  There are some
  discrepancies in accounts of glyphs 39 and 96: the supplied encodings
  (except CP1250 and CP1251) treat these as \sQuote{quoteright} and
  \sQuote{quoteleft} (rather than \sQuote{quotesingle}/\sQuote{acute}
  and \sQuote{grave} respectively), as they are in the Adobe
  documentation.
}

\section{TeX fonts}{
  TeX has traditionally made use of fonts such as Computer Modern which
  are encoded rather differently, in a 7-bit encoding.  This encoding
  can be specified by \code{encoding = "TeXtext.enc"}, taking care that
  the ASCII characters \code{< > \\ _ \{ \}} are not available in those
  fonts.

  There are supplied families \code{"ComputerModern"} and
  \code{"ComputerModernItalic"} which use this encoding, and which are
  only supported for \code{postscript} (and not \code{pdf}).  They are
  intended to use with the Type 1 versions of the TeX CM fonts.  It will
  normally be possible to include such output in TeX or LaTeX provided
  it is processed with \code{dvips -Ppfb -j0} or the equivalent on your
  system. (\code{-j0} turns off font subsetting.)  When \code{family =
    "ComputerModern"} is used, the italic/bold-italic fonts used are
  slanted fonts (\code{cmsl10} and \code{cmbxsl10}).  To use text italic
  fonts instead, set \code{family = "ComputerModernItalic"}.

  These families use the TeX math italic and  symbol fonts for a
  comprehensive but incomplete coverage of the glyphs covered by the
  Adobe symbol font in other families.  This is achieved by
  special-casing the postscript code generated from the supplied
  \file{CM_symbol_10.afm}.
}

\section{Color models}{
  The default color model (\code{"srgb"}) is sRGB.

  The alternative \code{"srgb+gray"} uses sRGB for colors, but with pure
  gray colors (including black and white) expressed as greyscales (which
  results in smaller files and can be advantageous with some printer
  drivers).  Conversely, its files can be rendered much slower on some
  viewers, and there can be a noticeable discontinuity in color
  gradients involving gray or white.

  Other possibilities are \code{"gray"} (or \code{"grey"}) which used
  only greyscales (and converts other colours to a luminance), and
  \code{"cmyk"}.  The simplest possible conversion from sRGB to CMYK is
  used
  (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model#Mapping_RGB_to_CMYK}),
  and raster images are output in RGB.

  Color models provided for backwards compatibility are \code{"rgb"}
  (which is RGB+gray) and \code{"rgb-nogray"} which use uncalibrated RGB
  (as used in \R prior to 2.13.0).  These result in slightly smaller
  files which may render faster, but do rely on the viewer being
  properly calibrated.
}

\section{Printing}{
  A postscript plot can be printed via \code{postscript} in two ways.
  \enumerate{
    \item Setting \code{print.it = TRUE} causes the command given in
    argument \code{command} to be called with argument \code{"file"}
    when the device is closed.  Note that the plot file is not deleted
    unless \code{command} arranges to delete it.

    \item \code{file = ""} or \code{file = "|cmd"} can be used to print
    using a pipe.  Failure to open the command will probably be reported
    to the terminal but not to \R, in which case close the
    device by \code{dev.off} immediately.
  }

  On Windows the default
  \code{"printcmd"} is empty and will give an error if
  \code{print.it = TRUE} is used.  Suitable commands to spool a PostScript
  file to a printer can be found in \file{RedMon} suite available from
  \url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html}.  The command will be
  run in a minimized window.   GSView 4.x provides \file{gsprint.exe}
  which may be more convenient (it requires Ghostscript version 6.50
  or later).
}
\section{Conventions}{
  This section describes the implementation of the conventions for
  graphics devices set out in the \dQuote{R Internals Manual}.

  \itemize{
    \item The default device size is 7 inches square.
    \item Font sizes are in big points.
    \item The default font family is Helvetica.
    \item Line widths are as a multiple of 1/96 inch, with a minimum
    of 0.01 enforced.
    \item Circle of any radius are allowed.
    \item Colours are by default specified as sRGB.
  }

  At very small line widths, the line type may be forced to solid.

  Raster images are currently limited to opaque colours.
}

\note{
  If you see problems with postscript output, do remember that the
  problem is much more likely to be in your viewer than in \R.  Try
  another viewer if possible.  Symptoms for which the viewer has been at
  fault are apparent grids on image plots (turn off graphics
  anti-aliasing in your viewer if you can) and missing or incorrect glyphs
  in text (viewers silently doing font substitution).

  Unfortunately the default viewers on most Linux and macOS systems
  have these problems, and no obvious way to turn off graphics anti-aliasing.
