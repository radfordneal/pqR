\description{
  \code{basename} removes all of the path up to and including the last
  path separator (if any).

  \code{dirname} returns the part of the \code{path} up to but
  excluding the last path separator, or \code{"."} if there is no path
  separator.
}
\usage{
basename(path)
dirname(path)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{character vector, containing path names.}
}
\details{
  \link{tilde expansion} of the path is done except on Windows.

  Trailing path separators are removed before dissecting the path,
  and for \code{dirname} any trailing file separators are removed
  from the result.
}
\section{Behaviour on Windows}{
  On Windows this will accept either \code{\\} or \code{/} as the path
  separator, but \code{dirname} will return a path using \code{/}
  (except if on a network share, when the leading \code{\\\\} will be
  preserved).  Expect these only to be able to handle complete
  paths, and not for example just a network share or a drive.

  UTF-8-encoded path names not valid in the current locale can be used.
}
\note{
  These are not wrappers for the POSIX system functions of the same
  names: in particular they do \strong{not} have the special handling of
  the path \code{"/"} and of returning \code{"."} for empty strings.
}
\value{
  A character vector of the same length as \code{path}.  A zero-length
  input will give a zero-length output with no error.

  Paths not containing any separators are taken to be in the current
  directory, so \code{dirname} returns \code{"."}.

  If an element of \code{path} is \code{\link{NA}}, so is the result.

  \code{""} is not a valid pathname, but is returned unchanged.
